			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So let us dance on the fringed waves,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">And shout at the wisest owls</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In their downy caps, and startle the naps</span>
				<br/>

				<span>That from the milk-white marble</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For ever foam and fret;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Far off in drowsy valleys</span>

				<span>Still staring at their flowers,</span>

				<span class="i1">That dull and faded are.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If one should rise beside thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The other is not far.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Go ask the youngest angel,</span>

				<span>Ghosts of her vanished glories, muse and stalk</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">About the sea. Before her lies that youth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Worn with long struggles; and the waves have sung</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Their passion and their restlessness and ruth</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through his sad soul for ever old and young,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Till their fierce miseries within his eyes</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="dl2">
					<span>Have lit lone tapers.</span>
					<span>Now the night was cast,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Making all one o’er rock and sea and skies;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And when once more the lightning Genii passed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Strewing upon the rocks their steel-blue hair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I saw him stagger with the clanking chain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Trailing and shining ’neath the flickering glare.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With little cries of joy he kissed the rain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In creviced rocks, and laughed to the old sea,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, nodding to and fro, sang songs of love,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And flowers and little children. Suddenly</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dropt down the velvet darkness from above,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hiding away the ocean’s yelping flocks.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When flash on flash once more the lightning came,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The youth had flung his arms around the rocks,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And in the sibyl’s eyes a languid flame</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was moving. Bleeding now, his grasp unlocks,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And he is dragged again before her feet.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Why not? He is her own; and crouching nigh</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bending her face o’er his, she watches meet</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And part his foaming mouth with eager eye⁠—</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To place a kiss of fire on the dim brow</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of Failure, and to crown her crownless head,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That all men evermore may humbly bow</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Down to the mother of the foiled and dead.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For this did the Eternal Darkness bring</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thither thy dust, and knead it with a cry,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gathered on her own lips, Oh youth, and fling</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Failure for glory down on thee, and mould</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thy withered foe, and with the purple wing</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of ocean fan thee into life, and fold</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For ever round thy waking and thy sleep</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The darkness of the whirlwind shattered deep.</span>

				<span>Tender and fearless on her funeral pyre;</span>

				<span>The Lion, the world’s great solitary, bends</span>

				<span>Lowly the head of his magnificence</span>

				<span>And roars, mad with the touch of the unknown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not as he shakes the forest; but a cry</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Low, long and musical. A dew-drop hung</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bright on a grass blade’s under side, might hear</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor tremble to its fall. The fire sweeps round</span>

				<span>Re-shining in his eyes. So ever moves</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The flaming circle of the outer Law,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor heeds the old, dim protest and the cry</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The orb of the most inner living heart</span>

				<span>Gives forth. He, the Eternal, works His will.</span>

									<span>Where men have heaped no burial mounds,</span>
									<br/>

									<br/>
									<span>Where broken faith has never been known,</span>

									<span>But knowing nor tumult nor hate nor strife,</span>

									<span>And a hundred maidens, merry as birds,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Who when they dance to a fitful measure</span>

									<span>All pearly white, save one red ear;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And now a maiden rode like the wind</span>
									<br/>
									<span>With an apple of gold in her tossing hand;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And a beautiful young man followed behind</span>
									<br/>
									<span>With quenchless eyes and fluttering hair.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>“Were these two born in the Danaan land,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Or have they breathed the mortal air?”</span>
									<br/>
									<span>“Vex them no longer,” Niam said,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And sighing bowed her gentle head,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And sighing laid the pearly tip</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Of one long finger on my lip.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>But now the moon like a white rose shone</span>
									<br/>
									<span>In the pale west, and the sun’s rim sank,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And clouds arrayed their rank on rank</span>
									<br/>
									<span>About his fading crimson ball:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The floor of Allen’s hosting hall</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Was not more level than the sea,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>As full of loving fantasy,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And with low murmurs we rode on,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Where many a trumpet-twisted shell</span>
									<br/>
									<span>That in immortal silence sleeps</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Dreaming of her own melting hues,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Her golds, her ambers, and her blues,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Pierced with soft light the shallowing deeps.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>But now a wandering land breeze came</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And a far sound of feathery quires;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>It seemed to blow from the dying flame,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>They seemed to sing in the smouldering fires.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The horse towards the music raced,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Neighing along the lifeless waste;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Like sooty fingers, many a tree</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Rose ever out of the warm sea;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And they were trembling ceaselessly,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>As though they all were beating time,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Upon the centre of the sun,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>To that low laughing woodland rhyme,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And, now our wandering hours were done,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>We cantered to the shore, and knew</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The reason of the trembling trees:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Round every branch the song-birds flew,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Or clung thereon like swarming bees;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>While round the shore a million stood</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Like drops of frozen rainbow light,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And pondered in a soft vain mood</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Upon their shadows in the tide,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And told the purple deeps their pride,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And murmured snatches of delight;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And on the shores were many boats</span>
									<br/>
									<span>With bending sterns and bending bows,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And carven figures on their prows</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Of bitterns, and fish-eating stoats,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And swans with their exultant throats:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And where the wood and waters meet</span>
									<br/>
									<span>We tied the horse in a leafy clump,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And Niam blew three merry notes</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Out of a little silver trump;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And then an answering whisper flew</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Over the bare and woody land,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>A whisper of impetuous feet,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And ever nearer, nearer grew;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And from the woods rushed out a band</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Of men and maidens, hand in hand,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And singing, singing altogether;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Their brows were white as fragrant milk,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Their cloaks made out of yellow silk,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And trimmed with many a crimson feather;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And when they saw the cloak I wore</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Was dim with mire of a mortal shore,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>They fingered it and gazed on me</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And laughed like murmurs of the sea;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>But Niam with a swift distress</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Bid them away and hold their peace;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And when they heard her voice they ran</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And knelt them, every maid and man</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And kissed, as they would never cease,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Her pearl-pale hand and the hem of her dress.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>She bade them bring us to the hall</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Where Aengus dreams, from sun to sun,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>A Druid dream of the end of days</span>
									<br/>
									<span>When the stars are to wane and the world be done.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>They led us by long and shadowy ways</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Where drops of dew in myriads fall,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And tangled creepers every hour</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Blossom in some new crimson flower,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And once a sudden laughter sprang</span>
									<br/>
									<span>From all their lips, and once they sang</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Together, while the dark woods rang,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And made in all their distant parts,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>With boom of bees in honey marts,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>A rumour of delighted hearts.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And once a maiden by my side</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Gave me a harp, and bade me sing,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And touch the laughing silver string;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>But when I sang of human joy</span>
									<br/>
									<span>A sorrow wrapped each merry face,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And, Patric! by your beard, they wept,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Until one came, a tearful boy;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>“A sadder creature never stepped</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Than this strange human bard,” he cried;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And caught the silver harp away,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And, weeping over the white strings, hurled</span>
									<br/>
									<span>It down in a leaf-hid, hollow place</span>
									<br/>
									<span>That kept dim waters from the sky;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And each one said with a long, long sigh,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>“O saddest harp in all the world,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Sleep there till the moon and the stars die!”</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>And now still sad we came to where</span>
									<br/>
									<span>A beautiful young man dreamed within</span>
									<br/>
									<span>A house of wattles, clay, and skin;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>One hand upheld his beardless chin;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And one a sceptre flashing out</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Wild flames of red and gold and blue,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Like to a merry wandering rout</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Of dancers leaping in the air;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And men and maidens knelt them there</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And showed their eyes with teardrops dim,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And with low murmurs prayed to him,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And kissed the sceptre with red lips,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And touched it with their finger-tips.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>He held that flashing sceptre up.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>“Joy drowns the twilight in the dew,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And fills with stars night’s purple cup,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And wakes the sluggard seeds of corn,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And stirs the young kid’s budding horn</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And makes the infant ferns unwrap,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And for the peewit paints his cap,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And rolls along the unwieldy sun,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And makes the little planets run:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And if joy were not on the earth,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>There were an end of change and birth,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And earth and heaven and hell would die,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And in some gloomy barrow lie</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Folded like a frozen fly;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Then mock at Death and Time with glances</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And waving arms and wandering dances.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>“Men’s hearts of old were drops of flame</span>
									<br/>
									<span>That from the saffron morning came,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Or drops of silver joy that fell</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Out of the moon’s pale twisted shell;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>But now hearts cry that hearts are slaves,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And toss and turn in narrow caves;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>But here there is nor law nor rule,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Nor have hands held a weary tool;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And here there is nor Change nor Death,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>But only kind and merry breath,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>For joy is God and God is joy.”</span>
									<br/>
									<span>With one long glance on maid and boy</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And the pale blossom of the moon,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>He fell into a Druid swoon.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>And in a wild and sudden dance</span>
									<br/>
									<span>We mocked at Time and Fate and Chance</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And swept out of the wattled hall</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And came to where the dewdrops fall</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Among the foamdrops of the sea,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And there we hushed the revelry;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And, gathering on our brows a frown,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Bent all our swaying bodies down,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And to the waves that glimmer by</span>
									<br/>
									<span>That slooping green De Danaan sod</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Sang, “God is joy and joy is God.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And things that have grown sad are wicked,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And things that fear the dawn of the morrow</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Or the gray wandering osprey Sorrow.”</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>We danced to where in the winding thicket</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The damask roses, bloom on bloom,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Like crimson meteors hang in the gloom,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And bending over them softly said,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Bending over them in the dance</span>
									<br/>
									<span>With a swift and friendly glance</span>
									<br/>
									<span>From dewy eyes: “Upon the dead</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Fall the leaves of other roses,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>On the dead dim earth encloses:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>But never, never on our graves,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Heaped beside the glimmering waves,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Shall fall the leaves of damask roses.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>For neither Death nor Change comes near us,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And all listless hours fear us,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And we fear no dawning morrow,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Nor the gray wandering osprey Sorrow.”</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>The dance wound through the windless woods:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The ever-summered solitudes;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Until the tossing arms grew still</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Upon the woody central hill;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And, gathered in a panting band,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>We flung on high each waving hand,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And sang unto the starry broods.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>In our raised eyes there flashed a glow</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Of milky brightness to and fro</span>
									<br/>
									<span>As thus our song arose: “You stars,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Across your wandering ruby cars</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Shake the loose reins: you slaves of God,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>He rules you with an iron rod,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>He holds you with an iron bond,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Each one woven to the other,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Each one woven to his brother</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Like bubbles in a frozen pond;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>But we in a lonely land abide</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Unchainable as the dim tide,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>With hearts that know nor law nor rule,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And hands that hold no wearisome tool,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Folded in love that fears no morrow,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Nor the grey wandering osprey Sorrow.”</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>O Patric! for a hundred years</span>
									<br/>
									<span>I chased upon that woody shore</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The deer, the badger, and the boar.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>O Patric! for a hundred years</span>
									<br/>
									<span>At evening on the glimmering sands,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Beside the piled-up hunting spears,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>These now outworn and withered hands</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Wrestled among the island bands.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>O Patric! for a hundred years</span>
									<br/>
									<span>We went a-fishing in long boats</span>
									<br/>
									<span>With bending sterns and bending bows,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And carven figures on their prows</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Of bitterns and fish-eating stoats.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>O Patric! for a hundred years</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The gentle Niam was my wife;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>But now two things devour my life;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The things that most of all I hate;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Fasting and prayers.</span>

									<span>Yes, yes.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>For these were ancient Oisin’s fate,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Loosed long ago from heaven’s gate,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>For his last days to lie in wait.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>When one day by the tide I stood,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>I found in that forgetfulness</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Of dreamy foam a staff of wood</span>
									<br/>
									<span>From some dead warrior’s broken lance:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>I turned it in my hands; the stains</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Of war were on it, and I wept,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Remembering how the Fenians stepped</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Along the blood-bedabbled plains,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Equal to good or grievous chance:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Thereon young Niam softly came</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And caught my hands, but spake no word</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Save only many times my name,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>In murmurs, like a frighted bird.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>We passed by woods, and lawns of clover,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And found the horse and bridled him,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>For we knew well the old was over.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>I heard one say, “his eyes grow dim</span>
									<br/>
									<span>With all the ancient sorrow of men”;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And wrapped in dreams rode out again</span>
									<br/>
									<span>With hoofs of the pale findrinny</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Over the glimmering purple sea:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Under the golden evening light.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The immortals moved among the fountains</span>
									<br/>
									<span>By rivers and the woods’ old night;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Some danced like shadows on the mountains,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Some wandered ever hand in hand;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Or sat in dreams on the pale strand,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Each forehead like an obscure star</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Bent down above each hooked knee,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And sang, and with a dreamy gaze</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Watched where the sun in a saffron blaze</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Was slumbering half in the sea ways;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And, as they sang, the painted birds</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Kept time with their bright wings and feet;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Like drops of honey came their words,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>But fainter than a young lamb’s bleat.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>“An old man stirs the fire to blaze,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>In the house of a child, of a friend, of a brother;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>He has over-lingered his welcome; the days,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Grown desolate, whisper and sigh to each other;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>He hears the storm in the chimney above,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And bends to the fire and shakes with the cold,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>While his heart still dreams of battle and love,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And the cry of the hounds on the hills of old.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>“But we are apart in the grassy places,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Where care cannot trouble the least of our days,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Or the softness of youth be gone from our faces,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Or love’s first tenderness die in our gaze.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The hare grows old as she plays in the sun</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And gazes around her with eyes of brightness;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Before the swift things that she dreamed of were done</span>
									<br/>
									<span>She limps along in an aged whiteness;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>A storm of birds in the Asian trees</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Like tulips in the air a-winging,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And the gentle waves of the summer seas,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>That raise their heads and wander singing,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Must murmur at last ‘Unjust, unjust’;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And ‘my speed is a weariness,’ falters the mouse,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And the kingfisher turns to a ball of dust,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And the roof falls in of his tunnelled house,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>But the love-dew dims our eyes till the day</span>
									<br/>
									<span>When God shall come from the sea with a sigh</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And bid the stars drop down from the sky,</span>

									<span>Now, man of croziers, shadows called our names</span>

									<span>And then away, away, like whirling flames;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And now fled by, mist-covered, without sound,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The youth and lady and the deer and hound;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>“Gaze no more on the phantoms,” Niam said,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And kissed my eyes, and, swaying her bright head</span>

									<span>Before God was or my old line began;</span>
									<br/>

									<br/>
									<span>That has drunk full, she crossed the misty sea</span>

									<br/>
									<span class="dl2">
										<span>Troubled her song.</span>
										<span>I do not know if days</span>

									<span>Shone many times among the glimmering flowers</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Woven in her hair, before dark towers</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Rose in the darkness, and the white surf gleamed</span>
									<br/>
									<span>About them; and the horse of faery screamed</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And shivered, knowing the Isle of many Fears,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Nor ceased until white Niam stroked his ears</span>
									<br/>
									<span class="dl2">
										<span>And named him by sweet names.</span>
										<span>A foaming tide</span>
									</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Whitened afar with surge, fan-formed and wide,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Burst from a great door marred by many a blow</span>
									<br/>
									<span>From mace and sword and pole-axe, long ago</span>
									<br/>
									<span>When gods and giants warred. We rode between</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The seaweed-covered pillars; and the green</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And surging phosphorus alone gave light</span>
									<br/>
									<span>On our dark pathway, till a countless flight</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Of moonlit steps glimmered; and left and right</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Dark statues glimmered over the pale tide</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Upon dark thrones. Between the lids of one</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The imaged meteors had flashed and run</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And had disported in the stilly jet,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And the fixed stars had dawned and shone and set,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Since God made Time and Death and Sleep: the other</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Stretched his long arm to where, a misty smother,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The stream churned, churned, and churned⁠—his lips apart,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>As though he told his never-slumbering heart</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Of every foamdrop on its misty way.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Tying the horse to his vast foot that lay</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Half in the unvesselled sea, we climbed the stairs</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And climbed so long, I thought the last steps were</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Hung from the morning star; when these mild words</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Fanned the delighted air like wings of birds:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>“My brothers spring out of their beds at morn,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>A-murmur like young partridge: with loud horn</span>
									<br/>
									<span>They chase the noontide deer;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And when the dew-drowned stars hang in the air</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Look to long fishing-lines, or point and pare</span>
									<br/>
									<span>An ashen hunting spear.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>“O sigh, O fluttering sigh, be kind to me;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Flutter along the froth lips of the sea,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And shore, the froth lips wet:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And stay a little while, and bid them weep:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Ah, touch their blue-veined eyelids if they sleep,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And shake their coverlet.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>“When you have told how I weep endlessly,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Flutter along the froth lips of the sea</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And home to me again,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And in the shadow of my hair lie hid,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And tell that you found a man unbid,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The saddest of all men.”</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>A lady with soft eyes like funeral tapers,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And face that seemed wrought out of moonlit vapours,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And a sad mouth, that fear made tremulous</span>
									<br/>
									<span>As any ruddy moth, looked down on us;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And she with a wave-rusted chain was tied</span>
									<br/>
									<span>To two old eagles, full of ancient pride,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>That with dim eyeballs stood on either side.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Few feathers were on their dishevelled wings,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>For their dim minds were with the ancient things.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>“I bring deliverance,” pearl-pale Niam said.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>“Neither the living, nor the unlabouring dead,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Nor the high gods who never lived, may fight</span>
									<br/>
									<span>My enemy and hope; demons for fright</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Jabber and scream about him in the night;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>For he is strong and crafty as the seas</span>
									<br/>
									<span>That sprang under the Seven Hazel Trees,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And I must needs endure and hate and weep.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Until the gods and demons drop asleep,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Hearing Aed touch the mournful strings of gold.”</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>“Is he so dreadful?”</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>“Be not over-bold,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>But, fly while still you may.”</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>And thereon I:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>“This demon shall be battered till he die,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And his loose bulk be thrown in the loud tide.”</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>“Flee from him,” pearl-pale Niam weeping cried,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>“For all men flee the demons”; but moved not</span>
									<br/>
									<span>My angry king-remembering soul one jot;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>There was no mightier soul of Heber’s line;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Now it is old and mouse-like. For a sign</span>
									<br/>
									<span>I burst the chain: still earless, nerveless, blind,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Wrapped in the things of the unhuman mind,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>In some dim memory or ancient mood</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Still earless, nerveless, blind, the eagles stood.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And then we climbed the stair to a high door;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>A hundred horsemen on the basalt floor</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Beneath had paced content: we held our way</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And stood within: clothed in a misty ray</span>
									<br/>
									<span>I saw a foam-white seagull drift and float</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Under the roof, and with a straining throat</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Shouted, and hailed him: he hung there a star.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>For no man’s cry shall ever mount so far;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Not even your God could have thrown down that hall;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Stabling His unloosed lightnings in their stall,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>He had sat down and sighed with cumbered heart,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>As though His hour were come.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>We sought the part</span>
									<br/>
									<span>That was most distant from the door; green slime</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Made the way slippery, and time on time</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Showed prints of sea-born scales, while down through it</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The captive’s journeys to and fro were writ</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Like a small river, and where feet touched, came</span>
									<br/>
									<span>A momentary gleam of phosphorus flame.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Under the deepest shadows of the hall</span>
									<br/>
									<span>That maiden found a ring hung on the wall,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And in the ring a torch, and with its flare</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Making a world about her in the air,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Passed under the dim doorway, out of sight</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And came again, holding a second light</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Burning between her fingers, and in mine</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Laid it and sighed: I held a sword whose shine</span>
									<br/>
									<span>No centuries could dim, and a word ran</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Thereon in Ogham letters, “Mananan”;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>That sea-god’s name, who in a deep content</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Sprang dripping, and, with captive demons sent</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Out of the seven-fold seas, built the dark hall</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Rooted in foam and clouds, and cried to all</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The mightier masters of a mightier race;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And at his cry there came no milk-pale face</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Under a crown of thorns and dark with blood,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>But only exultant faces.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>Niam stood</span>
									<br/>
									<span>With bowed head, trembling when the white blade shone,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>But she whose hours of tenderness were gone</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Had neither hope nor fear. I bade them hide</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Under the shadows till the tumults died</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Of the loud crashing and earth-shaking fight,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Lest they should look upon some dreadful sight,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And thrust the torch between the slimy flags.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>A dome made out of endless carven jags,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Where shadowy face flowed into shadowy face,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Looked down on me; and in the self-same place</span>
									<br/>
									<span>I waited hour by hour, and the high dome,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Windowless, pillarless, multitudinous home</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Of faces, waited; and the leisured gaze</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Was loaded with the memory of days</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Buried and mighty. When through the great door</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The dawn came in, and glimmered on the floor</span>
									<br/>
									<span>With a pale light, I journeyed round the hall</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And found a door deep sunken in the wall,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The least of doors; beyond on a dim plain</span>
									<br/>
									<span>A little runnel made a bubbling strain,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And on the runnel’s stony and bare edge</span>
									<br/>
									<span>A dusky demon dry as a withered sedge</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Swayed, crooning to himself an unknown tongue:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>In a sad revelry he sang and swung</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Bacchant and mournful, passing to and fro</span>
									<br/>
									<span>His hand along the runnel’s side, as though</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The flowers still grew there: far on the sea’s waste</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Shaking and waving, vapour vapour chased,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>While high frail cloudlets, fed with a green light,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Like drifts of leaves, immovable and bright,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Hung in the passionate dawn. He slowly turned:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>A demon’s leisure: eyes, first white, now burned</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Like wings of kingfishers; and he arose</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Barking. We trampled up and down with blows</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Of sword and brazen battle-axe, while day</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Gave to high noon and noon to night gave way</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And when he knew the sword of Mananan</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Amid the shades of night, he changed and ran</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Through many shapes; I lunged at the smooth throat</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Of a great eel; it changed, and I but smote</span>
									<br/>
									<span>A fir-tree roaring in its leafless top:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And thereupon I drew the livid chop</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Of a drowned dripping body to my breast;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Horror from horror grew; but when the west</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Had surged up in a plumy fire, I drave</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Through heart and spine; and cast him in the wave</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Lest Niam shudder.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>Full of hope and dread</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Those two came carrying wine and meat and bread,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And healed my wounds with unguents out of flowers</span>
									<br/>
									<span>That feed white moths by some De Danaan shrine:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Then in that hall, lit by the dim sea shine,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>We lay on skins of otters, and drank wine,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Brewed by the sea-gods, from huge cups that lay</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Upon the lips of sea-gods in their day;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And then on heaped-up skins of otters slept.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And when the sun once more in saffron stepped,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Rolling his flagrant wheel out of the deep,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>We sang the loves and angers without sleep,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And all the exultant labours of the strong.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>But now the lying clerics murder song</span>
									<br/>
									<span>With barren words and flatteries of the weak.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>In what land do the powerless turn the beak</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Of ravening Sorrow, or the hand of Wrath?</span>
									<br/>
									<span>For all your croziers, they have left the path</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And wander in the storms and clinging snows,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Hopeless for ever: ancient Usheen knows,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>For he is weak and poor and blind, and lies</span>
									<br/>
									<span>On the anvil of the world.</span>

									<span>Saint, do you weep? I hear amid the thunder</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The Fenian horses; armour torn asunder;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Laughter and cries. The armies clash and shock;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And now the daylight-darkening ravens flock.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Cease, cease, oh mournful, laughing Fenian horn!</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>We feasted for three days. On the fourth morn</span>
									<br/>
									<span>I found, dropping sea foam on the wide stair,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And hung with slime, and whispering in his hair,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>That demon dull and unsubduable;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And once more to a day-long battle fell,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And at the sundown threw him in the surge,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>To lie until the fourth morn saw emerge</span>
									<br/>
									<span>His new healed shape; and for a hundred years</span>
									<br/>
									<span>So warred, so feasted, with nor dreams nor fears,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Nor languor nor fatigue; an endless feast,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>An endless war.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>The hundred years had ceased;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>I stood upon the stair; the surges bore</span>
									<br/>
									<span>A beech bough to me, and my heart grew sore,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Remembering how I stood by white-haired Finn</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Under a beech at Allen and heard the thin</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Outcry of bats.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>And then young Niam came</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Holding that horse, and sadly called my name.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>I mounted, and we passed over the lone</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And drifting greyness, while this monotone,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Surly and distant, mixed inseparably</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Into the clangour of the wind and sea.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>“I hear my soul drop down into decay,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And Mananan’s dark tower, stone by stone,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Gather sea slime and fall the seaward way,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And the moon goad the waters night and day,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>That all be overthrown.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>“But till the moon has taken all, I wage</span>
									<br/>
									<span>War on the mightiest men under the skies,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And they have fallen or fled, age after age.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Light is man’s love, and lighter is man’s rage;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>His purpose drifts and dies.”</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>And then lost Niam murmured, “Love, we go</span>
									<br/>
									<span>To the Island of Forgetfulness, for lo!</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The Islands of Dancing and of Victories</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Are empty of all power.”</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>“And which of these</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Is the Island of Content?”</span>

									<span>Fled foam underneath us, and round us, a wandering and milky smoke,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>High as the saddle girth, covering away from our glances the tide;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And those that fled, and that followed, from the foam-pale distance broke;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The immortal desire of immortals we saw in their faces, and sighed.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>I mused on the chase with the Fenians, and Bran, Sgeolan, Lomair,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And never a song sang Niam, and over my finger-tips</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Came now the sliding of tears and sweeping of mist-cold hair,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And now the warmth of sighs, and after the quiver of lips.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>Were we days long or hours long in riding, when rolled in a grisly peace,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>An isle lay level before us, with dripping hazel and oak?</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And we stood on a sea’s edge we saw not; for whiter than new-washed fleece</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Fled foam underneath us, and round us, a wandering and milky smoke.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>And we rode on the plains of the sea’s edge; the sea’s edge barren and grey,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Grey sand on the green of the grasses and over the dripping trees,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Dripping and doubling landward, as though they would hasten away</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Like an army of old men longing for rest from the moan of the seas.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>But the trees grew taller and closer, immense in their wrinkling bark;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Dropping; a murmurous dropping; old silence and that one sound;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>For no live creatures lived there, no weasels moved in the dark:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Long sighs arose in our spirits, beneath us bubbled the ground.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>And the ears of the horse went sinking away in the hollow night,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>For, as drift from a sailor slow drowning the gleams of the world and the sun,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Ceased on our hands and our faces, on hazel and oak leaf, the light,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And the stars were blotted above us, and the whole of the world was one.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>Till the horse gave a whinny; for, cumbrous with stems of the hazel and oak,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>A valley flowed down from his hoofs, and there in the long grass lay,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Under the starlight and shadow, a monstrous slumbering folk,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Their naked and gleaming bodies poured out and heaped in the way.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>And by them were arrow and war-axe, arrow and shield and blade;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And dew-blanched horns, in whose hollow a child of three years old</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Could sleep on a couch of rushes, and all inwrought and inlaid,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And more comely than man can make them with bronze and silver and gold.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>And each of the huge white creatures was huger than fourscore men;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The tops of their ears were feathered, their hands were the claws of birds,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And, shaking the plumes of the grasses and the leaves of the mural glen,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The breathing came from those bodies, long-warless, grown whiter than curds.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>The wood was so spacious above them, that He who had stars for His flocks</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Could fondle the leaves with His fingers, nor go from His dew-cumbered skies;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>So long were they sleeping, the owls had builded their nests in their locks,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Filling the fibrous dimness with long generations of eyes.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>And over the limbs and the valley the slow owls wandered and came,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Now in a place of star-fire, and now in a shadow place wide:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And the chief of the huge white creatures, his knees in the soft star-flame,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Lay loose in a place of shadow: we drew the reins by his side.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>Golden the nails of his bird-claws, flung loosely along the dim ground;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>In one was a branch soft-shining with bells more many than sighs</span>
									<br/>
									<span>In midst of an old man’s bosom; owls ruffling and pacing around,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Sidled their bodies against him, filling the shade with their eyes.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>And my gaze was thronged with the sleepers; no, not since the world began,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>In realms where the handsome were many, nor in glamours by demons flung,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Have faces alive with such beauty been known to the salt eye of man,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Yet weary with passions that faded when the sevenfold seas were young.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>And I gazed on the bell-branch, sleep’s forebear, far sung by the Sennachies.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>I saw how those slumberers, grown weary, there camping in grasses deep,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Of wars with the wide world and pacing the shores of the wandering seas,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Laid hands on the bell-branch and swayed it, and fed of unhuman sleep.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>Snatching the horn of Niam, I blew a long lingering note.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Came sound from those monstrous sleepers, a sound like the stirring of flies.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>He, shaking the fold of his lips, and heaving the pillar of his throat,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Watched me with mournful wonder out of the wells of his eyes.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>I cried, “Come out of the shadow, king of the nails of gold!</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And tell of your goodly household and the goodly works of your hands,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>That we may muse in the starlight and talk of the battles of old;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Your questioner, Usheen, is worthy, he comes from the Fenian lands.”</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>Half open his eyes were, and held me, dull with the smoke of their dreams;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>His lips moved slowly in answer, no answer out of them came;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Then he swayed in his fingers the bell-branch, slow dropping a sound in faint streams</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Softer than snow-flakes in April and piercing the marrow like flame.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>Wrapt in the wave of that music, with weariness more than of earth,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The moil of my centuries filled me; and gone like a sea-covered stone</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Were the memories of the whole of my sorrow and the memories of the whole of my mirth,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And a softness came from the starlight and filled me full to the bone.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>In the roots of the grasses, the sorrels, I laid my body as low;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And the pearl-pale Niam lay by me, her brow on the midst of my breast;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And the horse was gone in the distance, and years after years ’gan flow;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Square leaves of the ivy moved over us, binding us down to our rest.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>And, man of the many white croziers, a century there I forgot;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>How the fetlocks drip blood in the battle, when the fallen on fallen lie rolled;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>How the falconer follows the falcon in the weeds of the heron’s plot,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And the names of the demons whose hammers made armour for Conhor of old.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>And, man of the many white croziers, a century there I forgot;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>That the spear-shaft is made out of ashwood, the shield out of ozier and hide;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>How the hammers spring on the anvil, on the spear-head’s burning spot,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>How the slow, blue-eyed oxen of Fin low sadly at evening tide.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>But in dreams, mild man of the croziers, driving the dust with their throngs,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Moved round me, of seamen or landsmen, all who are winter tales;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Came by me the kings of the Red Branch, with roaring of laughter and songs,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Or moved as they moved once, love-making or piercing the tempest with sails.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>Came Blanid, Mac Nessa, tall Fergus who feastward of old time slunk,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Cook Barach, the traitor; and warward, the spittle on his beard never dry,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Dark Balor, as old as a forest, car borne, his mighty head sunk</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Helpless, men lifting the lids of his weary and death-making eye.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>And by me, in soft red raiment, the Fenians moved in loud streams,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And Grania, walking and smiling, sewed with her needle of bone.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>So lived I and lived not, so wrought I and wrought not, with creatures of dreams,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>In a long iron sleep, as a fish in the water goes dumb as a stone.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>At times our slumber was lightened. When the sun was on silver or gold;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>When brushed with the wings of the owls, in the dimness they love going by;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>When a glow-worm was green on a grass leaf, lured from his lair in the mould;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Half-wakening, we lifted our eyelids, and gazed on the grass with a sigh.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>So watched I when, man of the croziers, at the heel of a century fell,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Weak, in the midst of the meadow, from his miles in the midst of the air,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>A starling like them that forgathered ’neath a moon waking white as a shell</span>
									<br/>
									<span>When the Fenians made foray at morning with Bran, Sgeolan, Lomair.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>I awoke: the strange horse without summons out of the distance ran,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Thrusting his nose to my shoulder; he knew in his bosom deep</span>
									<br/>
									<span>That once more moved in my bosom the ancient sadness of man,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And that I would leave the immortals, their dimness, their dews dropping sleep.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>O had you seen beautiful Niam grow white as the waters are white,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Lord of the croziers, you even had lifted your hands and wept:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>But, the bird in my fingers, I mounted, remembering alone that delight</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Of twilight and slumber were gone, and that hoofs impatiently stepped.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>I cried, “O Niam! O white one! if only a twelve-houred day,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>I must gaze on the beard of Finn, and move where the old men and young</span>
									<br/>
									<span>In the Fenians’ dwellings of wattle lean on the chessboards and play,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Ah, sweet to me now were even bald Conan’s slanderous tongue!</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>“Like me were some galley forsaken far off in Meridian isle.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Remembering its long-oared companions, sails turning to thread-bare rags;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>No more to crawl on the seas with long oars mile after mile,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>But to be amid shooting of flies and flowering of rushes and flags.”</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>Their motionless eyeballs of spirits grown mild with mysterious thought</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Watched her those seamless faces from the valley’s glimmering girth;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>As she murmured, “O wandering Usheen, the strength of the bell-branch is naught,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>For there moves alive in your fingers the fluttering sadness of earth.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>“Then go through the lands in the saddle and see what the mortals do,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And softly come to your Niam over the tops of the tide;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>But weep for your Niam, O Usheen, weep; for if only your shoe</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Brush lightly as haymouse earth’s pebbles, you will come no more to my side.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>“O flaming lion of the world, O when will you turn to your rest?”</span>
									<br/>
									<span>I saw from a distant saddle; from the earth she made her moan;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>“I would die like a small withered leaf in the autumn, for breast unto breast</span>
									<br/>
									<span>We shall mingle no more, nor our gazes empty their sweetness lone.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>“In the isles of the farthest seas where only the spirits come,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Were the winds less soft than the breath of a pigeon who sleeps on her nest,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Nor lost in the star-fires and odours the sound of the sea’s vague drum?</span>
									<br/>
									<span>O flaming lion of the world, O when will you turn to your rest?”</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>The wailing grew distant; I rode by the woods of the wrinkling bark,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Where ever is murmurous dropping, old silence and that one sound;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>For no live creatures live there, no weasels move in the dark;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>In a reverie forgetful of all things, over the bubbling ground.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>And I rode by the plains of the sea’s edge, where all is barren and grey,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Grey sands on the green of the grasses and over the dripping trees,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Dripping and doubling landward, as though they would hasten away,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Like an army of old men longing for rest from the moan of the seas.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>And the winds made the sands on the sea’s edge turning and turning go,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>As my mind made the names of the Fenians. Far from the hazel and oak,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>I rode away on the surges, where, high as the saddle bow,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Fled foam underneath me, and round me, a wandering and milky smoke.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>Long fled the foam-flakes around me, the winds fled out of the vast,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Snatching the bird in secret; nor knew I, embosomed apart,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>When they froze the cloth on my body like armour riveted fast,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>For Remembrance, lifting her leanness, keened in the gates of my heart.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>Till fattening the winds of the morning, an odour of new-mown hay</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Came and my forehead fell low, and my tears like berries fell down;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Later a sound came, half lost in the sound of a shore far away,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>From the great grass-barnacle calling, and later the shore-weeds brown.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>If I were as I once was, the strong hoofs crushing the sand and the shells,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Coming out of the sea as the dawn comes, a chaunt of love on my lips,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Not coughing, my head on my knees, and praying, and wroth with the bells,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>I would leave no saint’s head on his body from Rachlin to Bera of ships.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>Making way from the kindling surges, I rode on a bridle-path</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Much wondering to see upon all hands, of wattles and woodwork made,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Your bell-mounted churches, and guardless the sacred cairn and the rath,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And a small and a feeble populace stooping with mattock and spade.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>Or weeding or ploughing with faces a-shining with much-toil wet;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>While in this place and that place, with bodies unglorious their chieftains stood,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Awaiting in patience the straw-death, croziered one, caught in your net:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Went the laughter of scorn from my mouth like the roaring of wind in a wood.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>And because I went by them so huge and so speedy with eyes so bright,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Came after the hard gaze of youth, or an old man lifted his head:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And I rode and I rode, and I cried out, “The Fenians hunt wolves in the night,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>So sleep they by daytime.” A voice cried, “The Fenians a long time are dead.”</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>A whitebeard stood hushed on the pathway, the flesh of his face as dried grass,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And in folds round his eyes and his mouth, he sad as a child without milk;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And the dreams of the islands were gone, and I knew how men sorrow and pass,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And their hound, and their horse, and their love, and their eyes that glimmer like silk.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>And wrapping my face in my hair, I murmured, “In old age they ceased”;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And my tears were larger than berries, and I murmured, “Where white clouds lie spread</span>
									<br/>
									<span>On Crevroe or broad Knockfefin, with many of old they feast</span>
									<br/>
									<span>On the floors of the gods.” He cried, “No, the gods a long time are dead.”</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>And lonely and longing for Niam, I shivered and turned me about,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The heart in me longing to leap like a grasshopper into her heart;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>I turned and rode to the westward, and followed the sea’s old shout</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Till I saw where Maive lies sleeping till starlight and midnight part.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>And there at the foot of the mountain, two carried a sack full of sand,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>They bore it with staggering and sweating, but fell with their burden at length.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Leaning down from the gem-studded saddle, I flung it five yards with my hand,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>With a sob for men waxing so weakly, a sob for the Fenians’ old strength.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>The rest you have heard of, O croziered one; how, when divided the girth,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>I fell on the path, and the horse went away like a summer fly;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And my years three hundred fell on me, and I rose and walked on the earth,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>A creeping old man, full of sleep, with the spittle on his beard never dry.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>How the men of the sand-sack showed me a church with its belfry in air;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Sorry place, where for swing of the war-axe in my dim eyes the crozier gleams;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>What place have Caolte and Conan, and Bran, Sgeolan, Lomair?</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Speak, you too are old with your memories, an old man surrounded with dreams.</span>

				<span>Flames the shuttle of the lightning across the driving sleet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ay, and shakes in sea-green waverings along the fishers’ street;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gone the stars and gone the white moon, gone and puffed away and dead.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Never storm arose so swiftly; scarce the children were in bed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Scarce the old and wizen houses had their doors and windows shut.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ah! it dwelt within the twilight as the worm within the nut.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Waken, waken, sleepy fishers; no hour is this for sleep,”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cries a voice at roaring midnight beside the moonless deep.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Half dizzy with the lightning there runs a gathering band⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Watcher, wherefore have ye called us?” Eyes go after his lean hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the fisher men and women from the dripping harbour wall</span>
				<br/>
				<span>See the darkness slow disgorging a vessel blind with squall.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Bring the ropes now! Stand ye by now! See, she rounds the harbour clear.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>God! they’re mad to fly such canvas!” Ah! what bell-notes do they hear?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Say what ringer rings at midnight; for, in the belfry high,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Slow the chapel bell is tolling as though the dead passed by.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Round she comes in stays before them; cease the winds, and on their poles</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cease the sails their flapping uproar, and the hull no longer rolls.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now a scream from all those fishers, for there on deck there be</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All the drowned that ever were drowned from that village by the sea;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the ghastly ghost-flames glimmer all along the taffrail rails</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the drowned men’s hands and faces, on the spars and on the sails.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hush’d the fishers, till a mother calls by name her drownèd son;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then each wife and maid and mother calls by name some drownèd one.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stands each grey and silent phantom on the same regardless spot⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Joys and fears in their grey faces that the live earth knoweth not;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Down the vapours fall and hide them from the children of a day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the winds come down and blow them with the vapours far away.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hang the mist-threads for a little while like cobwebs in the air;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then the stars grow out of heaven with their countenances fair.</span>

				<span>“Pray for the souls in purgatory,” the pale priest trembling cries.</span>
			</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>
				<span>Prayed those forgotten fishers, till in the eastern skies</span>

				<span>We, too, have seen our bravest and our best</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To prisons go, and mossy ruin rest</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where homes once whitened vale and mountain crest;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Therefore, O nation of the bleeding breast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Libations, from the Hungary of the West.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Before his tent the General sips his wine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Waves off the flies, and warms him in the shine.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Austrian Haynau he, in many lands</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Famous, a man of rules, a victor. Stands</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Before him one well guarded, with bound hands;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Schoolmaster he, a dreamer, fiddler, first</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In every dance, by children sought. “Accurst,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thy name is?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Renyi.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Of?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“This village.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Good!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hiding the rebels worm in yonder wood</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or yonder mountains. Where? Thou shalt be free⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Silence! Thou shalt be dead!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Now suddenly</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The spirit of young Renyi has grown old.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He turns where, hung like drops of dripping gold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Flashing and flickering with ever-undulant wing</span>
				<br/>
				<span>About a sun-flushed dove-cot, cooing, cling</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The doves whose growing forms he’d watched. Not these</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He numbers. He a brown farm-house sees,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where shadow of cherry, and shadow of apple trees,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Enclose a quiet place of beds box-bordered, bees,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hives, currant bushes. There his kin are. High</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Above, the woods where with the soft mild eye</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of her he loved fixed on him full of light,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Often he had bent down some bough all bright</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With berries. Placid as a homeward bee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Glad, simple⁠—nay, he sought not mystery,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor, gazing forth where life’s sad sickles reap,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Searched the unsearchable⁠—why good men weep;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Why those who do good often be not good,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Why they who will the highest sometimes brood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Clogged in a marsh where the slow marsh clay clings,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Abolished by a mire of little things,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="dl2">
					<span>Untuned by their own striving.</span>
					<span>If one such</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Were here, he would turn death into a crutch;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="dl2">
					<span>But this one⁠—this one.</span>
					<span>Now his head drops low,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Drops on his bosom, sombre, moist and slow.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Choose!” Restless Haynau’s fingers tapping go.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This sullen peasant spoils the good sunshine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This sullen peasant spoils the good red wine.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He whispers to a soldier, who goes out⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A neighbouring cricket lifts his shrilly shout</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Reiterant. A bird goes by the tent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A lizard crawls⁠—the two men gaze intent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As though they’d vowed to measure all its ways.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Returns that soldier in the evening rays</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Half hid. He brings the peasant’s only kin,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Two women, withered one and small and thin,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bent low with toil and hoariest years. The other</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="dl2">
					<span>Of middle age.</span>
					<span>“His sister here and mother.”</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The soldier thus, and Haynau⁠—“Peasant, speak</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If these be precious.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“I am old and weak,”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That ancient mother cries, “speak not, my son.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I’m weak, and by the hands shall hold each one</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of my dead children soon, whate’er betide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For I am old and weak.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And at her side</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The sister: “Sell thy country, and the shame</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of traitor evermore is on our name.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Haynau, the man of system, lifts his hand</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Serene. They’re led away, and where a band</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of soldiers ranked is on a grassy spot,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A score of yards off ’neath a willow, shot.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Now hath he kith or kin, or any friend?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A soldier answers: “By the camp’s far end</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I saw a girl afraid to be too near,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Afraid to be too far.” “Ay, bring her here!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Time goes. The flakèd fire of evening crawls</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Along the tents, the fields, the village walls.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The hare hath laid asleep her frolic wits,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And every flower above its shadow sits.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“On this embroidered cloud,” the sun hath said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“A little will I lay my weary head,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Among the gold, the amber, and the red.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A careful field-mouse finds a fallen crumb;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now steps draw close, he hides beneath a drum.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That maiden bring they. When the tall red deer</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In trouble is, the doe will linger near.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A peasant pale and pretty, her eyes for fear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like small brown moths, a-tremble.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Renyi say</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where worm the rebels, or my bullets lay</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The young one with the others.” Renyi’s pale</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But speechless, and the maiden with long wail</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Flings her before him. “Save thyself and me.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Speak, Ferencz, speak. We love each other. See,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I am so young. Dost thou no longer know,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beloved, how two little years ago</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I came the first time to thy village school?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou hast forgotten. On the oaken stool</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I sat me down beside thee, and I knew</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So little. As the months passed by we grew</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To love each other. In my prayer-book still</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The violets are that on the wooded hill</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We gathered. Ferencz, nay, I must not die:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I am to be your wife. A village high</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And lost and far in yonder hills I know;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There far away from all we two will go,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And be so happy.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To his hands she clings,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With cries and murmurs. Suddenly he flings</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Away her clinging hands, and turns. She throws</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her arms around his feet. The signal goes</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From Haynau’s lifted fingers⁠—two draw nigh</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And seize her, and thus floats her quivering cry:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Assassin, my assassin! thou who let’st me die,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I curse thee⁠—curse thee!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Renyi silent stands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And she is dragged to where the willow bands</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With quiet shade its ever dewy-plot.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Noise! and a flash, a momentary blot.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So ends a brain⁠—a world!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The smoke goes up,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Creeping along the heavens’ purple cup,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Higher and higher gold with evening light;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It seems to fondle, with a finger bright</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And soft, one glimmering star.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Renyi has cast</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His bonds away, sore struggling.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Now at last</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Haynau, thine hour has come, thy followers far</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beside the willow.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Nay, to yonder star,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yon bauble of the heavens, he lifts his hands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And over tillage fields and pasture lands</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where lies the cow at peace beside her calf,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He rushes, rolling from his lips a madman’s laugh.</span>

			<h2 epub:type="title">The Priest and the Fairy</h2>
			<p>
				<span>Unto the heart of the woodland straying,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where the shaking leaf with the beam was playing,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Musingly wandered the village priest.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As the summer voice of the daytime ceased,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He came to the home of the forest people</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From where the old ivy crawls round the old steeple,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And under a shady oak-tree sat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where the moss was spread like his own doormat.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The tangled thoughts of the finished day</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fled from his brow where the hair was grey;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And as the time to darkness plodded,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He thought wise things as his grey head nodded.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>How “the only good is musing mild,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And evil still is action’s child.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“With action all the world is vexed,”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He’d find for this some holy text.</span>
			</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>
				<span>He’d slept among the singing trees,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Among the murmurs of the bees,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>A full hour long, when rose a feather</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Out of a neighbouring bunch of heather;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And then a pointed face was seen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beneath a pointed cap of green;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And straight before the sleeping priest</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There stood a man, of men the least⁠—</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Three spans high as he rose to his feet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And his hair was as yellow as waving wheat.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Now, what has a fairy to do with a priest</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who is six feet high in his socks at least?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He drew from his cap a feather grey,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the nose of the sleeper he made it play;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The sleeper awoke with a sudden start,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With open mouth and beating heart.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He had dreamed the cow had got within</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His garden ringed with jessamine,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And many a purple gillyflower eaten,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And under her hoofs the marigolds beaten.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then ’gan to speak that goblin rare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brushing back his yellow hair:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Man of wisdom, from thy sleeping</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I have roused thee; for the weeping</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Of our great queen is ever heard</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Among the haunts of bee and bird.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“We buried late in a hazel dell</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A fairy whom we loved full well;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“The swiftest he to dance or fly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And his hair was as dark as a plover’s eye.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Man of wisdom, dost thou know</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where the souls of fairies go?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>This priest looked neither to right nor left,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nigh of his wits by fear bereft.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Ave Marie,” muttered he</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Over the beads of his rosary.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The fairies’ herald spake once more:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Say and thrice anigh thy door</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Every summer wilt thou see</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wild bees’ honey laid for thee.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The father dropt his rosary⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“They are lost, they are lost, each one,” cried he.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And then his heart grew well-nigh dead</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Because of the thing his tongue had said.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>As a wreath of smoke in wind-blown flight</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The fairy vanished from his sight,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And came to where his brethren stood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Away in the heart of the antique wood;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And when they heard that tale of his</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They grew so very still, I wis</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Were you a fairy you’d have heard</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The breathing of the smallest bird,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The beating of a lev’ret’s heart;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And then the fay queen sobbed apart,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And all the sad fay chivalry</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Upraised their voices bitterly.</span>
			</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>
				<span>A woodman on his homeward way</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Heard the voice of their dismay,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And said, “Yon bittern cries, in truth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As though his days were full of ruth.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“If I were free to do as little</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As dance upon the spear-grass brittle,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Or seek where sweetest water bubbles,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Remote from all the hard earth troubles,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And cut no wood the whole day long,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I’d glad folks’ hearts with blither song.”</span>

				<h3 epub:type="title">Cuchulain’s Fight with the Sea</h3>
				<p>
					<span>A man came slowly from the setting sun,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To Emer, raddling raiment in her dun,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And said, “I am that swineherd, whom you bid</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Go watch the road between the wood and tide,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But now I have no need to watch it more.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Then Emer cast the web upon the floor,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And raising arms all raddled with the dye;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Parted her lips with a loud sudden cry.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>That swineherd stared upon her face and said:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“No man alive, no man among the dead,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Has won the gold his cars of battle bring.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“But if your master comes home triumphing</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Why are you pale and shake from foot to crown?”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Thereon he shook the more and cast him down</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon the web-heaped floor, and cried his word:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“With him is one sweet-throated like a bird.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“You dare me to my face,” and thereupon</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She smote with raddled fist, and where her son</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Herded the cattle came with stumbling feet,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And cried with angry voice, “It is not meet</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To idle life away, a common herd.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“I have long waited, mother, for that word:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But wherefore now?”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“There is a man to die;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>You have the heaviest arm under the sky.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Whether under its daylight or the stars</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My father stands amid his battle cars.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“But you have grown to be the taller man.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Yet somewhere under starlight or the sun</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My father stands amid his battle cars.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“But he is old and sad with many wars.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“I only ask what way my journey lies.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For He who made you bitter, made you wise.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“The Red Branch camp in a great company</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Between wood’s rim and the horses of the sea.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Go there, and light a camp fire at wood’s rim;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But tell your name and lineage to him</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whose blade compels, and wait till they have found</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Some feating man that the same oath has bound.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Among those feasting kings Cuchulain dwelt,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And his young sweetheart close beside him knelt,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Stared on the mournful wonder of his eyes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Even as Spring upon the ancient skies,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And pondered on the glory of his days;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And all around the harp-string told his praise,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And Conchubar, the Red Branch king of kings,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With his own fingers touched the brazen strings.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>At last Cuchulain spake, “Some man has made</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His evening fire amid the leafy shade.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I have often heard him singing to and fro,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I have often heard the sweet sound of his bow,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Seek out what man he is.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>One went and came.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“He bade me let all know he gives his name</span>
					<br/>
					<span>At the sword point, and waits till we have found</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Some feating man that the same oath has bound.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Cuchulain cried, “I am the only man</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of all this host so bound from childhood on.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>After short fighting in the leafy shade,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He spake to the young man, “Is there no maid</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who loves you, no white arms to wrap you round,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or do you long for the dim sleepy ground,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That you have come and dared me to my face?”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“The dooms of men are in God’s hidden place.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Your head a while seemed like a woman’s head</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That I loved once.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Again the fighting sped,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But now the war rage in Cuchulain woke,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And through that new blade’s guard the old blade broke,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And pierced him.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Speak before your breath is done.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Cuchulain I, mighty Cuchulain’s son.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“I put you from your pain. I can no more.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>While day its burden on to evening bore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With head bowed on his knees Cuchulain stayed;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then Conchubar sent that sweet-throated maid,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And she, to win him, his grey hair caressed;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In vain her arms, in vain her soft white breast.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then Conchubar, the subtlest of all men,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ranking his Druids round him ten by ten,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Spake thus, “Cuchulain will dwell there and brood,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For three days more in dreadful quietude,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And then arise, and raving slay us all.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Chaunt in his ear delusions magical,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That he may fight the horses of the sea.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Druids took them to their mystery,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And chanted for three days.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Cuchulain stirred,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Stared on the horses of the sea, and heard</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The cars of battle and his own name cried;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And fought with the invulnerable tide.</span>

					<span>Rose of all Roses, Rose of all the World!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The tall thought-woven sails, that flap unfurled</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Above the tide of hours, trouble the air,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And God’s bell buoyed to be the water’s care;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>While hushed from fear, or loud with hope, a band</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With blown, spray-dabbled hair gather at hand.</span>
					<br/>
					<q>
						<span>Turn if you may from battles never done,</span>
						<br/>
					</q>
					<span>I call, as they go by me one by one,</span>
					<br/>
					<q>
						<span>Danger no refuge holds, and war no peace,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For him who hears love sing and never cease,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Beside her clean-swept hearth, her quiet shade:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But gather all for whom no love hath made</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A woven silence, or but came to cast</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A song into the air, and singing past</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To smile on the pale dawn; and gather you</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Who have sought more than is in rain or dew</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or in the sun and moon, or on the earth,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or sighs amid the wandering, starry mirth,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or comes in laughter from the sea’s sad lips</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And wage God’s battles in the long grey ships.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The sad, the lonely, the insatiable,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To these Old Night shall all her mystery tell;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>God’s bell has claimed them by the little cry</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of their sad hearts, that may not live nor die.</span>
					</q>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Rose of all Roses, Rose of all the World!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>You, too, have come where the dim tides are hurled</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon the wharves of sorrow, and heard ring</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The bell that calls us on; the sweet far thing.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Beauty grown sad with its eternity</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Made you of us, and of the dim grey sea.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Our long ships loose thought-woven sails and wait,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For God has bid them share an equal fate;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And when at last defeated in His wars,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They have gone down under the same white stars,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We shall no longer hear the little cry</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of our sad hearts, that may not live nor die.</span>

				<p>
					<span>He stood among a crowd at Drumahair;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His heart hung all upon a silken dress,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he had known at last some tenderness,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Before earth made of him her sleepy care;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But when a man poured fish into a pile,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It seemed they raised their little silver heads,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And sang how day a Druid twilight sheds</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon a dim, green, well-beloved isle,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where people love beside star-laden seas;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How Time may never mar their faery vows</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Under the woven roofs of quicken boughs:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The singing shook him out of his new ease.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>He wandered by the sands of Lisadell;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His mind ran all on money cares and fears,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he had known at last some prudent years</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Before they heaped his grave under the hill;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But while he passed before a plashy place,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A lug-worm with its gray and muddy mouth</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sang how somewhere to north or west or south</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There dwelt a gay, exulting, gentle race;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And how beneath those three times blessed skies</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A Danaan fruitage makes a shower of moons,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And as it falls awakens leafy tunes:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And at that singing he was no more wise.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>He mused beside the well of Scanavin,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He mused upon his mockers: without fail</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His sudden vengeance were a country tale,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now that deep earth has drunk his body in;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But one small knot-grass growing by the pool</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Told where, ah, little, all-unneeded voice!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Old Silence bids a lonely folk rejoice,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And chaplet their calm brows with leafage cool,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And how, when fades the sea-strewn rose of day,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A gentle feeling wraps them like a fleece,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And all their trouble dies into its peace:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The tale drove his fine angry mood away.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>He slept under the hill of Lugnagall;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And might have known at last unhaunted sleep</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Under that cold and vapour-turbaned steep,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now that old earth had taken man and all:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Were not the worms that spired about his bones</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Proclaiming with a low and reedy cry,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That God had leant His hands out of the sky,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To bless that isle with honey in His tones;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That none may feel the power of squall and wave</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And no one any leaf-crowned dancer miss</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Until He burn up Nature with a kiss:</span>

				<p>
					<span>The old priest Peter Gilligan</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was weary night and day;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For half his flock were in their beds,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or under green sods lay.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Once, while he nodded on a chair,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>At the moth-hour of eve,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Another poor man sent for him,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he began to grieve.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“I have no rest, nor joy, nor peace,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For people die and die”;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And after cried he, “God forgive!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My body spake, not I!”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>He knelt, and leaning on the chair</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He prayed and fell asleep;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the moth-hour went from the fields,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And stars began to peep.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>They slowly into millions grew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And leaves shook in the wind;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And God covered the world with shade,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And whispered to mankind.</span>

					<span>When the moths came once more,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The old priest Peter Gilligan</span>

					<span>Stood upright on the floor.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Mavrone, mavrone! the man has died,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>While I slept on the chair”;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He roused his horse out of its sleep,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And rode with little care.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>He rode now as he never rode,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By rocky lane and fen;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The sick man’s wife opened the door:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Father! you come again!”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“And is the poor man dead?” he cried.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“He died an hour ago,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The old priest Peter Gilligan</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In grief swayed to and fro.</span>

					<span>As merry as a bird.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The old priest Peter Gilligan</span>

					<span>He knelt him at that word.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“He who hath made the night of stars</span>

					<span>For souls, who tire and bleed,</span>

					<span>Tossing and tossing to and fro</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The flaming circle of our life.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When looking on their shaken hair,</span>

					<span>And dreaming how they dance and dart,</span>

					<span>The glass of outer weariness,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Made when God slept in times of old.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There, through the broken branches, go</span>

					<br/>
					<span>Peering and flying to and fro,</span>

					<span>To see men’s souls bartered and bought.</span>

					<span>For God goes by with white foot-fall.</span>

				<p>
					<span>There was a man whom Sorrow named his friend</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he, of his high comrade Sorrow dreaming,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Went walking with slow steps along the gleaming</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And humming sands, where windy surges wend:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he called loudly to the stars to bend</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From their pale thrones and comfort him, but they</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Among themselves laugh on and sing alway:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And then the man whom Sorrow named his friend</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Cried out, <q>Dim sea, hear my most piteous story!</q></span>
					<br/>
					<span>The sea swept on and cried her old cry still,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Rolling along in dreams from hill to hill;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He fled the persecution of her glory</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, in a far-off, gentle valley stopping,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Cried all his story to the dewdrops glistening,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But naught they heard, for they are always listening,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The dewdrops, for the sound of their own dropping.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And then the man whom Sorrow named his friend,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sought once again the shore, and found a shell,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And thought, <q>I will my heavy story tell</q></span>
					<br/>
					<q>
						<span>Till my own words, re-echoing, shall send</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Their sadness through a hollow, pearly heart;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And my own tale again for me shall sing,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And my own whispering words be comforting,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And lo! my ancient burden may depart.</span>
						<br/>
					</q>
					<span>Then he sang softly nigh the pearly rim;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But the sad dweller by the sea-ways lone</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Changed all he sang to inarticulate moan</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Among her wildering whirls, forgetting him.</span>

					<span>I passed along the water’s edge below the humid trees,</span>

					<span>My spirit rocked in sleep and sighs; and saw the moorfowl pace</span>

					<span>All dripping on a grassy slope, and saw them cease to chase</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Each other round in circles, and heard the eldest speak:</span>
					<br/>
					<q>
						<span>Who holds the world between His bill and made us strong or weak</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Is an undying moorfowl, and He lives beyond the sky,</span>

						<span>The rains are from His dripping wing, the moonbeams from His eye.</span>

						<span>For I am in His image made, and all this tinkling tide</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Is but a sliding drop of rain between His petals wide.</span>
						<br/>
					</q>
					<span>A little way within the gloom a roebuck raised his eyes</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Brimful of starlight, and he said: <q>The Stamper of the Skies,</q></span>
					<br/>
					<q>
						<span>He is a gentle roebuck; for how else, I pray, could He</span>
						<br/>

					<span>The island dreams under the dawn</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And great boughs drop tranquillity;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The peahens dance on a smooth lawn,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A parrot sways upon a tree,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Raging at his own image in the enamelled sea.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Here we will moor our lonely ship</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And wander ever with woven hands,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Murmuring softly lip to lip,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Along the grass, along the sands,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Murmuring how far away are the unquiet lands:</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>How we alone of mortals are</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hid under quiet bows apart,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>While our love grows an Indian star,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A meteor of the burning heart,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>One with the tide that gleams, the wings that gleam and dart,</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The heavy boughs, the burnished dove</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That moans and sighs a hundred days:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How when we die our shades will rove,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When eve has hushed the feathered ways,</span>

					<span>With vapoury footsole among the water’s drowsy blaze.</span>

					<span>And over the mice in the barley sheaves;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yellow the leaves of the rowan above us,</span>

				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The hour of the waning of love has beset us,</span>

					<span>Are bowed in sorrow under their trembling lids,</span>

				</p>
				<p>

				<p>
					<span>The woods were round them, and the yellow leaves</span>

					<span>Gathered in silence, dewy as her eyes,</span>

					<span class="dl2">
						<span>In bosom and hair.</span>
						<span>“Ah, do not mourn,” he said,</span>

					<span>Hate on and love through unrepining hours.</span>

					<span>I sat on cushioned otter skin:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My word was law from Ith to Emen,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And shook at Invar Amargin</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The hearts of the world-troubling seamen,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And drove tumult and war away</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From girl and boy and man and beast;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The fields grew fatter day by day,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The wild fowl of the air increased;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And every ancient Ollave said,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>While he bent down his fading head,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“He drives away the Northern cold.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They will not hush, the leaves a-flutter round me, the beech leaves old.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I sat and mused and drank sweet wine;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A herdsman came from inland valleys,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Crying, the pirates drove his swine</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To fill their dark-beaked hollow galleys.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I called my battle-breaking men,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And my loud brazen battle-cars</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From rolling vale and rivery glen;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And under the blinking of the stars</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Fell on the pirates by the deep,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And hurled them in the gulf of sleep:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>These hands won many a torque of gold.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They will not hush, the leaves a-flutter round me, the beech leaves old.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But slowly, as I shouting slew</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And trampled in the bubbling mire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In my most secret spirit grew</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A whirling and a wandering fire:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I stood: keen stars above me shone,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Around me shone keen eyes of men:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I laughed aloud and hurried on</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By rocky shore and rushy fen;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I laughed because birds fluttered by,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And starlight gleamed, and clouds flew high,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And rushes waved and waters rolled.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They will not hush, the leaves a-flutter round me, the beech leaves old.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And now I wander in the woods</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When summer gluts the golden bees,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or in autumnal solitudes</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Arise the leopard-coloured trees,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or when along the wintry strands</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The cormorants shiver on their rocks;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I wander on, and wave my hands,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And sing, and shake my heavy locks.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The grey wolf knows me; by one ear</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I lead along the woodland deer;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The hares run by me growing bold.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They will not hush, the leaves a-flutter round me, the beech leaves old.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I came upon a little town,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That slumbered in the harvest moon,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And passed a-tiptoe up and down,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Murmuring, to a fitful tune,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How I have followed, night and day,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A tramping of tremendous feet,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And saw where this old tympan lay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Deserted on a doorway seat,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And bore it to the woods with me;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of some unhuman misery</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Our married voices wildly trolled.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They will not hush, the leaves a-flutter round me, the beech leaves old.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I sang how, when day’s toil is done,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Orchil shakes out her long dark hair</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That hides away the dying sun</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And sheds faint odours through the air:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When my hand passed from wire to wire</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It quenched, with sound like falling dew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The whirling and the wandering fire;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But lift a mournful ulalu,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For the kind wires are torn and still,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I must wander wood and hill</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Through summer’s heat and winter’s cold.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They will not hush, the leaves a-flutter round me, the beech leaves old.</span>

					<br/>
					<span>Sleiveens were all his race;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he gave them as dowers to his daughters,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And they married beyond their place.</span>

					<span>From the wives, and the cats, and the children,</span>

					<span>To the birds in the white of the air.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The birds, for he opened their cages</span>

					<span>As he went up and down;</span>

					<span>And he said with a smile, “Have peace now”;</span>

					<span>And he went his way with a frown.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But if when any one died</span>

				<p>
					<span>My man was a poor fisher</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With shore lines in the say;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My work was saltin’ herrings</span>

					<span>The whole of the long day.</span>

					<span>And sometimes from the saltin’ shed,</span>

					<br/>
					<span>Under the blessed moonlight,</span>

					<span>Ye little childer dear,</span>

					<span>When the morn grew frosty and clear.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>A weary woman sleeps so hard!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My man grew red and pale,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And gave me money, and bade me go</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To my own place, Kinsale.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>He drove me out and shut the door,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And gave his curse to me;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I went away in silence,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>No neighbour could I see.</span>

					<span>The windows and the doors were shut,</span>

					<span>The little straws were turnin’ round</span>

					<span>Blowin’ her mornin’ fire.</span>

					<span>“Lay me in a cushioned chair;</span>

					<span>Carry me, ye four,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With cushions here and cushions there,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To see the world once more.</span>

				<p>
					<span>“To stable and to kennel go;</span>

					<span>Lead my Lollard to and fro,</span>

				</p>
				<p>
					<span>His eyelids droop, his head falls low,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His old eyes cloud with dreams;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The sun upon all things that grow</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Falls in sleepy streams.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Brown Lollard treads upon the lawn,</span>
					<br/>

					<br/>
					<span>And now the old man’s dreams are gone,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He smooths the long brown nose.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And now moves many a pleasant tongue</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon his wasted hands,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For leading aged hounds and young</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The huntsman near him stands.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Huntsman, Rody, blow the horn,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And make the hills reply.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The huntsman loosens on the morn</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A gay wandering cry.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Fire is in the old man’s eyes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His fingers move and sway,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And when the wandering music dies</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They hear him feebly say,</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Huntsman, Rody, blow the horn,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And make the hills reply.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“I cannot blow upon my horn,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I can but weep and sigh.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Servants round his cushioned place</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Are with new sorrow wrung;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And hounds are gazing on his face,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Both aged hounds and young.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>One blind hound only lies apart</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On the sun-smitten grass;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He holds deep commune with his heart:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The moments pass and pass;</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The blind hound with a mournful din</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lifts slow his wintry head;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The servants bear the body in;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The hounds wail for the dead.</span>

			<h2 epub:type="title">The Old Age of Queen Maeve</h2>
			<p>
				<span>Maeve the great queen was pacing to and fro,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Between the walls covered with beaten bronze,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In her high house at Cruachan; the long hearth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Flickering with ash and hazel, but half showed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where the tired horse-boys lay upon the rushes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or on the benches underneath the walls,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In comfortable sleep; all living slept</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But that great queen, who more than half the night</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had paced from door to fire and fire to door.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Though now in her old age, in her young age</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She had been beautiful in that old way</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That’s all but gone; for the proud heart is gone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the fool heart of the counting-house fears all</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But soft beauty and indolent desire.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She could have called over the rim of the world</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whatever woman’s lover had hit her fancy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And yet had been great bodied and great limbed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fashioned to be the mother of strong children;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And she’d had lucky eyes and a high heart,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And wisdom that caught fire like the dried flax,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At need, and made her beautiful and fierce,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="dl2">
					<span>Sudden and laughing.</span>
					<span>O unquiet heart,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Why do you praise another, praising her,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As if there were no tale but your own tale</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Worth knitting to a measure of sweet sound?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Have I not bid you tell of that great queen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who has been buried some two thousand years?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When night was at its deepest, a wild goose</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cried from the porter’s lodge, and with long clamour</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shook the ale horns and shields upon their hooks;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But the horse-boys slept on, as though some power</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had filled the house with Druid heaviness;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And wondering who of the many-changing Sidhe</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had come as in the old times to counsel her,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Maeve walked, yet with slow footfall, being old,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To that small chamber by the outer gate.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The porter slept, although he sat upright</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With still and stony limbs and open eyes.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Maeve waited, and when that ear-piercing noise</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Broke from his parted lips and broke again,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She laid a hand on either of his shoulders,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And shook him wide awake, and bid him say</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who of the wandering many-changing ones</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had troubled his sleep. But all he had to say</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was that, the air being heavy and the dogs</span>
				<br/>
				<span>More still than they had been for a good month,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He had fallen asleep, and, though he had dreamed nothing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He could remember when he had had fine dreams.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It was before the time of the great war</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Over the White-Horned Bull, and the Brown Bull.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>She turned away; he turned again to sleep</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That no god troubled now, and, wondering</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What matters were afoot among the Sidhe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Maeve walked through that great hall, and with a sigh</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lifted the curtain of her sleeping-room,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Remembering that she too had seemed divine</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To many thousand eyes, and to her own</span>
				<br/>
				<span>One that the generations had long waited</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That work too difficult for mortal hands</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Might be accomplished. Bunching the curtain up</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She saw her husband Ailell sleeping there,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And thought of days when he’d had a straight body,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And of that famous Fergus, Nessa’s husband,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who had been the lover of her middle life.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Suddenly Ailell spoke out of his sleep,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And not with his own voice or a man’s voice,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But with the burning, live, unshaken voice,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of those that it may be can never age.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He said, “High Queen of Cruachan and Magh Ai,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A king of the Great Plain would speak with you.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And with glad voice Maeve answered him, “What king</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the far wandering shadows has come to me?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As in the old days when they would come and go</span>
				<br/>
				<span>About my threshold to counsel and to help.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The parted lips replied, “I seek your help,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For I am Aengus, and I am crossed in love.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“How may a mortal whose life gutters out</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Help them that wander with hand clasping hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their haughty images that cannot wither,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For all their beauty’s like a hollow dream,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mirrored in streams that neither hail nor rain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="dl2">
					<span>Nor the cold North has troubled?”</span>
					<span>He replied:</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I am from those rivers and I bid you call</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The children of the Maines out of sleep,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And set them digging under Bual’s hill.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We shadows, while they uproot his earthy house,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Will overthrow his shadows and carry off</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Caer, his blue-eyed daughter that I love.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I helped your fathers when they built these walls,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And I would have your help in my great need,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="dl2">
					<span>Queen of high Cruachan.”</span>
					<span>“I obey your will</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With speedy feet and a most thankful heart:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For you have been, O Aengus of the birds,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Our giver of good counsel and good luck.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And with a groan, as if the mortal breath</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Could but awaken sadly upon lips</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That happier breath had moved, her husband turned</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Face downward, tossing in a troubled sleep;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But Maeve, and not with a slow feeble foot,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Came to the threshold of the painted house,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where her grandchildren slept, and cried aloud,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Until the pillared dark began to stir</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With shouting and the clang of unhooked arms.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She told them of the many-changing ones;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all that night, and all through the next day</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To middle night, they dug into the hill.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At middle night great cats with silver claws,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bodies of shadow and blind eyes like pearls,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Came up out of the hole, and red-eared hounds</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With long white bodies came out of the air</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Suddenly, and ran at them and harried them.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The Maines’ children dropped their spades, and stood</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With quaking joints and terror-strucken faces,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till Maeve called out: “These are but common men.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Maines’ children have not dropped their spades,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Because Earth, crazy for its broken power,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Casts up a show and the winds answer it</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With holy shadows.” Her high heart was glad,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And when the uproar ran along the grass</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She followed with light footfall in the midst,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till it died out where an old thorn tree stood.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Friend of these many years, you too had stood</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With equal courage in that whirling rout;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For you, although you’ve not her wandering heart,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Have all that greatness, and not hers alone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For there is no high story about queens</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In any ancient book but tells of you;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And when I’ve heard how they grew old and died,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or fell into unhappiness, I’ve said:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“She will grow old and die, and she has wept!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And when I’d write it out anew, the words,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Half crazy with the thought, She too has wept!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="dl2">
					<span>Outrun the measure.</span>
					<span>I’d tell of that great queen</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who stood amid a silence by the thorn</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Until two lovers came out of the air</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With bodies made out of soft fire. The one,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>About whose face birds wagged their fiery wings,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Said: “Aengus and his sweetheart give their thanks</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To Maeve and to Maeve’s household, owing all</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In owing them the bride-bed that gives peace.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then Maeve: “O Aengus, Master of all lovers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A thousand years ago you held high talk</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With the first kings of many-pillared Cruachan.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="dl2">
					<span>O when will you grow weary?”</span>
					<span>They had vanished;</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But out of the dark air over her head there came</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A murmur of soft words and meeting lips.</span>

			<p>
				<span>I hardly hear the curlew cry,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor the grey rush when the wind is high,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Before my thoughts begin to run</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the heir of Ulad, Buan’s son,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Baile, who had the honey mouth;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And that mild woman of the south,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Aillinn, who was King Lugaid’s heir.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their love was never drowned in care</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of this or that thing, nor grew cold</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Because their bodies had grown old.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Being forbid to marry on earth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They blossomed to immortal mirth.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>About the time when Christ was born,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When the long wars for the White Horn</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the Brown Bull had not yet come,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Young Baile Honey-Mouth, whom some</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Called rather Baile Little-Land,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rode out of Emain with a band</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of harpers and young men; and they</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Imagined, as they struck the way</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To many-pastured Muirthemne,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That all things fell out happily,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And there, for all that fools had said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Baile and Aillinn would be wed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>They found an old man running there:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He had ragged long grass-coloured hair;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He had knees that stuck out of his hose;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He had puddle water in his shoes;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He had half a cloak to keep him dry,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Although he had a squirrel’s eye.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>O wandering birds and rushy beds,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>You put such folly in our heads</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With all this crying in the wind;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No common love is to our mind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And our poor Kate or Nan is less</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Than any whose unhappiness</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Awoke the harp-strings long ago.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet they that know all things but know</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That all life had to give us is</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A child’s laughter, a woman’s kiss.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who was it put so great a scorn</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the grey reeds that night and morn</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Are trodden and broken by the herds,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And in the light bodies of birds</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That north wind tumbles to and fro</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And pinches among hail and snow?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>That runner said: “I am from the south;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I run to Baile Honey-Mouth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To tell him how the girl Aillinn</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rode from the country of her kin,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And old and young men rode with her:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For all that country had been astir</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If anybody half as fair</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had chosen a husband anywhere</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But where it could see her every day.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When they had ridden a little way</span>
				<br/>
				<span>An old man caught the horse’s head</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With: ‘You must home again, and wed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With somebody in your own land.’</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A young man cried and kissed her hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘O lady, wed with one of us’;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And when no face grew piteous</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For any gentle thing she spake,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She fell and died of the heart-break.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Because a lover’s heart’s worn out,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Being tumbled and blown about</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By its own blind imagining,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And will believe that anything</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That is bad enough to be true, is true,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Baile’s heart was broken in two;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And he being laid upon green boughs,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was carried to the goodly house</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where the Hound of Ulad sat before</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The brazen pillars of his door,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His face bowed low to weep the end</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the harper’s daughter and her friend.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For although years had passed away</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He always wept them on that day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For on that day they had been betrayed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And now that Honey-Mouth is laid</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Under a cairn of sleepy stone</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Before his eyes, he has tears for none,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Although he is carrying stone, but two</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For whom the cairn’s but heaped anew.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>We hold because our memory is</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So full of that thing and of this</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That out of sight is out of mind.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But the grey rush under the wind</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the grey bird with crooked bill</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Have such long memories, that they still</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Remember Deirdre and her man;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And when we walk with Kate or Nan</span>
				<br/>
				<span>About the windy water side,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Our heart can hear the voices chide.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How could we be so soon content,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who know the way that Naoise went?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And they have news of Deirdre’s eyes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who being lovely was so wise⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ah! wise, my heart knows well how wise.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Now had that old gaunt crafty one,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gathering his cloak about him, run</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where Aillinn rode with waiting maids,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who amid leafy lights and shades</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dreamed of the hands that would unlace</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their bodices in some dim place</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When they had come to the marriage bed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And harpers, pacing with high head</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As though their music were enough</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To make the savage heart of love</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Grow gentle without sorrowing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Imagining and pondering</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Heaven knows what calamity;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Another’s hurried off,” cried he,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“From heat and cold and wind and wave;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They have heaped the stones above his grave</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In Muirthemne, and over it</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In changeless Ogham letters writ⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span><q>Baile, that was of Rury’s seed</q>.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But the gods long ago decreed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No waiting maid should ever spread</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Baile and Aillinn’s marriage bed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For they should clip and clip again</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where wild bees hive on the Great Plain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Therefore it is but little news</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That put this hurry in my shoes.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then seeing that he scarce had spoke</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Before her love-worn heart had broke,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He ran and laughed until he came</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To that high hill the herdsmen name</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Hill Seat of Leighin, because</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Some god or king had made the laws</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That held the land together there,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In old times among the clouds of the air.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>That old man climbed; the day grew dim;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Two swans came flying up to him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Linked by a gold chain each to each,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And with low murmuring laughing speech</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Alighted on the windy grass.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They knew him: his changed body was</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tall, proud and ruddy, and light wings</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Were hovering over the harp-strings</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That Etain, Midhir’s wife, had wove</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the hid place, being crazed by love.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>What shall I call them? fish that swim,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Scale rubbing scale where light is dim</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By a broad water-lily leaf;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or mice in the one wheaten sheaf</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Forgotten at the threshing place;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or birds lost in the one clear space</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of morning light in a dim sky;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or, it may be, the eyelids of one eye,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or the door pillars of one house,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or two sweet blossoming apple-boughs</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That have one shadow on the ground;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or the two strings that made one sound</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where that wise harper’s finger ran.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For this young girl and this young man</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Have happiness without an end,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Because they have made so good a friend.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>They know all wonders, for they pass</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The towery gates of Gorias,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Findrias and Falias,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And long-forgotten Murias,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Among the giant kings whose hoard,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cauldron and spear and stone and sword,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was robbed before earth gave the wheat;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wandering from broken street to street</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They come where some huge watcher is,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And tremble with their love and kiss.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>They know undying things, for they</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wander where earth withers away,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Though nothing troubles the great streams</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But light from the pale stars, and gleams</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the holy orchards, where there is none</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But fruit that is of precious stone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or apples of the sun and moon.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>What were our praise to them? They eat</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Quiet’s wild heart, like daily meat;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who when night thickens are afloat</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On dappled skins in a glass boat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Far out under a windless sky;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While over them birds of Aengus fly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And over the tiller and the prow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And waving white wings to and fro</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Awaken wanderings of light air</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To stir their coverlet and their hair.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And poets found, old writers say,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A yew tree where his body lay;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But a wild apple hid the grass</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With its sweet blossom where hers was;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And being in good heart, because</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A better time had come again</span>
				<br/>
				<span>After the deaths of many men,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And that long fighting at the ford,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They wrote on tablets of thin board,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Made of the apple and the yew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All the love stories that they knew.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Let rush and bird cry out their fill</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the harper’s daughter if they will,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beloved, I am not afraid of her.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She is not wiser nor lovelier,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And you are more high of heart than she,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For all her wanderings over-sea;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But I’d have bird and rush forget</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Those other two; for never yet</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Has lover lived, but longed to wive</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like them that are no more alive.</span>

				<h3 epub:type="title">Adam’s Curse</h3>
				<p>
					<span>We sat together at one summer’s end,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That beautiful mild woman, your close friend,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And you and I, and talked of poetry.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I said: “A line will take us hours maybe;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet if it does not seem a moment’s thought,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Our stitching and unstitching has been naught.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Better go down upon your marrow bones</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And scrub a kitchen pavement, or break stones</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Like an old pauper, in all kinds of weather;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For to articulate sweet sounds together</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Is to work harder than all these, and yet</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Be thought an idler by the noisy set</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of bankers, schoolmasters, and clergymen</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The martyrs call the world.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And thereupon</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That beautiful mild woman for whose sake</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There’s many a one shall find out all heartache</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On finding that her voice is sweet and low</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Replied: “To be born woman is to know,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Although they do not talk of it at school⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That we must labour to be beautiful.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I said: “It’s certain there is no fine thing</span>

					<span>Since Adam’s fall but needs much labouring.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There have been lovers who thought love should be</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So much compounded of high courtesy</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That they would sigh and quote with learned looks</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Precedents out of beautiful old books;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet now it seems an idle trade enough.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>We sat grown quiet at the name of love;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We saw the last embers of daylight die,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And in the trembling blue-green of the sky</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A moon, worn as if it had been a shell</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Washed by time’s waters as they rose and fell</span>
					<br/>
					<span>About the stars and broke in days and years.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I had a thought for no one’s but your ears;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That you were beautiful, and that I strove</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To love you in the old high way of love;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That it had all seemed happy, and yet we’d grown</span>

				<h3 epub:type="title">The Shadowy Waters</h3>
				<p>
					<span>I walked among the seven woods of Coole,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Shan-walla, where a willow-bordered pond</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Gathers the wild duck from the winter dawn;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Shady Kyle-dortha; sunnier Kyle-na-gno,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where many hundred squirrels are as happy</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As though they had been hidden by green boughs,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where old age cannot find them; Pairc-na-lea,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where hazel and ash and privet blind the paths;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Dim Pairc-na-carraig, where the wild bees fling</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Their sudden fragrances on the green air;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Dim Pairc-na-tarav, where enchanted eyes</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Have seen immortal, mild, proud shadows walk;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Dim Inchy wood, that hides badger and fox</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And marten-cat, and borders that old wood</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Wise Biddy Early called the wicked wood:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Seven odours, seven murmurs, seven woods.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I had not eyes like those enchanted eyes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet dreamed that beings happier than men</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Moved round me in the shadows, and at night</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My dreams were cloven by voices and by fires;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the images I have woven in this story</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of Forgael and Dectora and the empty waters</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Moved round me in the voices and the fires,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And more I may not write of, for they that cleave</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The waters of sleep can make a chattering tongue</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Heavy like stone, their wisdom being half silence.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How shall I name you, immortal, mild, proud shadows?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I only know that all we know comes from you,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And that you come from Eden on flying feet.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Is Eden far away, or do you hide</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From human thought, as hares and mice and coneys</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That run before the reaping-hook and lie</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In the last ridge of the barley? Do our wood</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And winds and ponds cover more quiet woods,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>More shining winds, more star-glimmering ponds?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Is Eden out of time and out of space?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And do you gather about us when pale light</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Shining on water and fallen among leaves,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And winds blowing from flowers, and whirr of feathers</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the green quiet, have uplifted the heart?</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I have made this poem for you, that men may read it</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Before they read of Forgael and Dectora,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As men in the old times, before the harps began,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Poured out wine for the high invisible ones.</span>

				<h3 epub:type="title">The Harp of Aengus</h3>
				<p>
					<span>Edain came out of Midher’s hill, and lay</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Beside young Aengus in his tower of glass,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where time is drowned in odour-laden winds</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And druid moons, and murmuring of boughs,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And sleepy boughs, and boughs where apples made</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of opal and ruby and pale chrysolite</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Awake unsleeping fires; and wove seven strings,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sweet with all music, out of his long hair,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Because her hands had been made wild by love.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When Midher’s wife had changed her to a fly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He made a harp with druid apple wood</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That she among her winds might know he wept;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And from that hour he has watched over none</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But faithful lovers.</span>

					<span>There was no mother’s son but said,</span>

				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And after running at the brim</span>

					<span>Cried out upon that thing beneath,</span>

					<span>—It had such dignity of limb⁠—</span>

					<span>“He shadowed in a glass</span>

					<span>What I have done, or what would do</span>
					<br/>

					<span>Was done to make it plain;</span>

				<p>
					<span>That every year I have cried, “At length</span>

					<span>And words obey my call”;</span>

					<span>Dear Craoibhin Aoibhin, look into our case.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When we are high and airy hundreds say</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That if we hold that flight they’ll leave the place,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>While those same hundreds mock another day</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Because we have made our art of common things,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So bitterly, you’d dream they longed to look</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All their lives through into some drift of wings.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>You’ve dandled them and fed them from the book</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And know them to the bone; impart to us⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We’ll keep the secret⁠—a new trick to please.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Is there a bridle for this Proteus</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That turns and changes like his draughty seas?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or is there none, most popular of men,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But when they mock us that we mock again?</span>

					<span>Poets with whom I learned my trade,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Companions of the Cheshire Cheese,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Here’s an old story I’ve re-made,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Imagining ’twould better please</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Your ears than stories now in fashion,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Though you may think I waste my breath</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Pretending that there can be passion</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That has more life in it than death,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And though at bottling of your wine</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The bow-legged Goban had no say;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The moral’s yours because it’s mine.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>When cups went round at close of day⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Is not that how good stories run?⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The gods were sitting at the board</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In their great house at Slievenamon.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They sang a drowsy song, or snored,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For all were full of wine and meat.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The smoky torches made a glare</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On metal Goban ’d hammered at,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On old deep silver rolling there</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or on some still unemptied cup</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That he, when frenzy stirred his thews,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Had hammered out on mountain top</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To hold the sacred stuff he brews</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That only gods may buy of him.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Now from the juice that made them wise</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All those had lifted up the dim</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Imaginations of their eyes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For one that was like woman made</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Before their sleepy eyelids ran</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And trembling with her passion said,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Come out and dig for a dead man,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who’s burrowing somewhere in the ground,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And mock him to his face and then</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hollo him on with horse and hound,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For he is the worst of all dead men.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>We should be dazed and terror-struck,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If we but saw in dreams that room,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Those wine-drenched eyes, and curse our luck</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That emptied all our days to come.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I knew a woman none could please,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Because she dreamed when but a child</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of men and women made like these;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And after, when her blood ran wild,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Had ravelled her own story out,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And said, “In two or in three years</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I need must marry some poor lout,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And having said it burst in tears.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Since, tavern comrades, you have died,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Maybe your images have stood,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Mere bone and muscle thrown aside,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Before that roomful or as good.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>You had to face your ends when young⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>’Twas wine or women, or some curse⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But never made a poorer song</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That you might have a heavier purse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor gave loud service to a cause</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That you might have a troop of friends.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>You kept the Muses’ sterner laws,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And unrepenting faced your ends,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And therefore earned the right⁠—and yet</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Dowson and Johnson most I praise⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To troop with those the world’s forgot,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And copy their proud steady gaze.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“The Danish troop was driven out</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Between the dawn and dusk,” she said;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Although the event was long in doubt,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Although the King of Ireland’s dead</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And half the kings, before sundown</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All was accomplished. When this day</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Murrough, the King of Ireland’s son,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Foot after foot was giving way,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He and his best troops back to back</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Had perished there, but the Danes ran,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Stricken with panic from the attack,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The shouting of an unseen man;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And being thankful Murrough found,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Led by a footsole dipped in blood</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That had made prints upon the ground,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where by old thorn trees that man stood;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And though when he gazed here and there,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He had but gazed on thorn trees, spoke,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>‘Who is the friend that seems but air</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And yet could give so fine a stroke?’</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thereon a young man met his eye,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who said, ‘Because she held me in</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her love, and would not have me die,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Rock-nurtured Aoife took a pin,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And pushing it into my shirt,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Promised that for a pin’s sake,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>No man should see to do me hurt;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But there it’s gone; I will not take</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The fortune that had been my shame</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Seeing, King’s son, what wounds you have.’</span>
					<br/>
					<span>’Twas roundly spoke, but when night came</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He had betrayed me to his grave,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For he and the King’s son were dead.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I’d promised him two hundred years,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And when for all I’d done or said⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And these immortal eyes shed tears⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He claimed his country’s need was most,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I’d save his life, yet for the sake</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of a new friend he has turned a ghost.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What does he care if my heart break?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I call for spade and horse and hound</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That we may harry him.” Thereon</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She cast herself upon the ground</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And rent her clothes and made her moan:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Why are they faithless when their might</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Is from the holy shades that rove</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The grey rock and the windy light?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Why should the faithfullest heart most love</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The bitter sweetness of false faces?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Why must the lasting love what passes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Why are the gods by men betrayed!”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But thereon every god stood up</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With a slow smile and without sound,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And stretching forth his arm and cup</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To where she moaned upon the ground,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Suddenly drenched her to the skin;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And she with Goban’s wine adrip,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>No more remembering what had been,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Stared at the gods with laughing lip.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I have kept my faith, though faith was tried,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To that rock-born, rock-wandering foot,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the world’s altered since you died,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I am in no good repute</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With the loud host before the sea,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That think sword strokes were better meant</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Than lover’s music⁠—let that be,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So that the wandering foot’s content.</span>

				<h3 epub:type="title">The Two Kings</h3>
				<p>
					<span>King Eochaid came at sundown to a wood</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Westward of Tara. Hurrying to his queen</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He had out-ridden his war-wasted men</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That with empounded cattle trod the mire;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And where beech trees had mixed a pale green light</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With the ground-ivy’s blue, he saw a stag</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whiter than curds, its eyes the tint of the sea.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Because it stood upon his path and seemed</span>
					<br/>
					<span>More hands in height than any stag in the world</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He sat with tightened rein and loosened mouth</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon his trembling horse, then drove the spur;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But the stag stooped and ran at him, and passed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Rending the horse’s flank. King Eochaid reeled</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then drew his sword to hold its levelled point</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Against the stag. When horn and steel were met</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The horn resounded as though it had been silver,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A sweet, miraculous, terrifying sound.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Horn locked in sword, they tugged and struggled there</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As though a stag and unicorn were met</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In Africa on Mountain of the Moon,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Until at last the double horns, drawn backward,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Butted below the single and so pierced</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The entrails of the horse. Dropping his sword</span>
					<br/>
					<span>King Eochaid seized the horns in his strong hands</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And stared into the sea-green eye, and so</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hither and thither to and fro they trod</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till all the place was beaten into mire.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The strong thigh and the agile thigh were met,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The hands that gathered up the might of the world,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And hoof and horn that had sucked in their speed</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Amid the elaborate wilderness of the air.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Through bush they plunged and over ivied root,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And where the stone struck fire, while in the leaves</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A squirrel whinnied and a bird screamed out;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But when at last he forced those sinewy flanks</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Against a beech bole, he threw down the beast</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And knelt above it with drawn knife. On the instant</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It vanished like a shadow, and a cry</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So mournful that it seemed the cry of one</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who had lost some unimaginable treasure</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Wandered between the blue and the green leaf</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And climbed into the air, crumbling away,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till all had seemed a shadow or a vision</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But for the trodden mire, the pool of blood,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="dl2">
						<span>The disembowelled horse.</span>
						<span>King Eochaid ran,</span>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Toward peopled Tara, nor stood to draw his breath</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Until he came before the painted wall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The posts of polished yew, circled with bronze,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of the great door; but though the hanging lamps</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Showed their faint light through the unshuttered windows,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor door, nor mouth, nor slipper made a noise,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor on the ancient beaten paths, that wound</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From well-side or from plough-land, was there noise;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And there had been no sound of living thing</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Before him or behind, but that far-off</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On the horizon edge bellowed the herds.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Knowing that silence brings no good to kings,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And mocks returning victory, he passed</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Between the pillars with a beating heart</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And saw where in the midst of the great hall</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Pale-faced, alone upon a bench, Edain</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sat upright with a sword before her feet.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her hands on either side had gripped the bench,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her eyes were cold and steady, her lips tight.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Some passion had made her stone. Hearing a foot</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She started and then knew whose foot it was;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But when he thought to take her in his arms</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She motioned him afar, and rose and spoke:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“I have sent among the fields or to the woods</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The fighting men and servants of this house,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For I would have your judgment upon one</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who is self-accused. If she be innocent</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She would not look in any known man’s face</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till judgment has been given, and if guilty,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Will never look again on known man’s face.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And at these words he paled, as she had paled,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Knowing that he should find upon her lips</span>
					<br/>

						<span>The meaning of that monstrous day.</span>
						<span>Then she:</span>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“You brought me where your brother Ardan sat</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Always in his one seat, and bid me care him</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Through that strange illness that had fixed him there,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And should he die to heap his burial mound</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And carve his name in Ogham.” Eochaid said,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“He lives?” “He lives and is a healthy man.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“While I have him and you it matters little</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What man you have lost, what evil you have found.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“I bid them make his bed under this roof</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And carried him his food with my own hands,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And so the weeks passed by. But when I said</span>
					<br/>
					<span>‘What is this trouble?’ he would answer nothing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Though always at my words his trouble grew;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I but asked the more, till he cried out,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Weary of many questions: ‘There are things</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That make the heart akin to the dumb stone.’</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then I replied: ‘Although you hide a secret,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hopeless and dear, or terrible to think on,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Speak it, that I may send through the wide world</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For medicine.’ Thereon he cried aloud:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>‘Day after day you question me, and I,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Because there is such a storm amid my thoughts</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I shall be carried in the gust, command,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Forbid, beseech and waste my breath.’ Then I,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>‘Although the thing that you have hid were evil,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The speaking of it could be no great wrong,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And evil must it be, if done ’twere worse</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Than mound and stone that keep all virtue in,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And loosen on us dreams that waste our life,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Shadows and shows that can but turn the brain.’</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But finding him still silent I stooped down</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And whispering that none but he should hear,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Said: ‘If a woman has put this on you,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My men, whether it please her or displease,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And though they have to cross the Loughlan waters</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And take her in the middle of armed men,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Shall make her look upon her handiwork,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That she may quench the rick she has fired; and though</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She may have worn silk clothes, or worn a crown,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She’ll not be proud, knowing within her heart</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That our sufficient portion of the world</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Is that we give, although it be brief giving,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Happiness to children and to men.’</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then he, driven by his thought beyond his thought,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And speaking what he would not though he would,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sighed: ‘You, even you yourself, could work the cure!’</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And at those words I rose and I went out</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And for nine days he had food from other hands,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And for nine days my mind went whirling round</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The one disastrous zodiac, muttering</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That the immedicable mound’s beyond</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Our questioning, beyond our pity even.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But when nine days had gone I stood again</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Before his chair and bending down my head</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Told him, that when Orion rose, and all</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The women of his household were asleep,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To go⁠—for hope would give his limbs the power⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To an old empty woodman’s house that’s hidden</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Close to a clump of beech trees in the wood</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Westward of Tara, there to await a friend</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That could, as he had told her, work his cure</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="dl2">
						<span>And would be no harsh friend.</span>
						<span>When night had deepened,</span>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I groped my way through boughs, and over roots,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till oak and hazel ceased and beech began,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And found the house, a sputtering torch within,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And stretched out sleeping on a pile of skins</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ardan, and though I called to him and tried</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To shake him out of sleep, I could not rouse him.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I waited till the night was on the turn,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then fearing that some labourer, on his way</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To plough or pasture-land, might see me there,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="dl2">
						<span>Went out.</span>
						<span>Among the ivy-covered rocks,</span>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As on the blue light of a sword, a man</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who had unnatural majesty, and eyes</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Like the eyes of some great kite scouring the woods,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Stood on my path. Trembling from head to foot</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I gazed at him like grouse upon a kite;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But with a voice that had unnatural music,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>‘A weary wooing and a long,’ he said,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>‘Speaking of love through other lips and looking</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Under the eyelids of another, for it was my craft</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That put a passion in the sleeper there,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And when I had got my will and drawn you here,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where I may speak to you alone, my craft</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sucked up the passion out of him again</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And left mere sleep. He’ll wake when the sun wakes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Push out his vigorous limbs and rub his eyes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And wonder what has ailed him these twelve months.’</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I cowered back upon the wall in terror,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But that sweet-sounding voice ran on: ‘Woman,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I was your husband when you rode the air,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Danced in the whirling foam and in the dust,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In days you have not kept in memory,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Being betrayed into a cradle, and I come</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That I may claim you as my wife again.’</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I was no longer terrified, his voice</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Had half awakened some old memory,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet answered him: ‘I am King Eochaid’s wife</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And with him have found every happiness</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Women can find.’ With a most masterful voice,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That made the body seem as it were a string</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Under a bow, he cried: ‘What happiness</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Can lovers have that know their happiness</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Must end at the dumb stone? But where we build</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Our sudden palaces in the still air</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Pleasure itself can bring no weariness,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor can time waste the cheek, nor is there foot</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That has grown weary of the whirling dance,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor an unlaughing mouth, but mine that mourns,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Among those mouths that sing their sweethearts’ praise,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Your empty bed.’ ‘How should I love,’ I answered,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>‘Were it not that when the dawn has lit my bed</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And shown my husband sleeping there, I have sighed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Your strength and nobleness will pass away.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or how should love be worth its pains were it not</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That when he has fallen asleep within my arms,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Being wearied out, I love in man the child?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What can they know of love that do not know</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She builds her nest upon a narrow ledge</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Above a windy precipice?’ Then he:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>‘Seeing that when you come to the death-bed</span>
					<br/>
					<span>You must return, whether you would or no,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This human life blotted from memory,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Why must I live some thirty, forty years,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Alone with all this useless happiness?’</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thereon he seized me in his arms, but I</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thrust him away with both my hands and cried,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>‘Never will I believe there is any change</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Can blot out of my memory this life</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sweetened by death, but if I could believe</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That were a double hunger in my lips</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="dl2">
						<span>For what is doubly brief.’</span>
						<span>And now the shape,</span>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My hands were pressed to, vanished suddenly.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I staggered, but a beech tree stayed my fall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And clinging to it I could hear the cocks</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="dl2">
						<span>Crow upon Tara.”</span>
						<span>King Eochaid bowed his head</span>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And thanked her for her kindness to his brother,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For that she promised, and for that refused.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Thereon the bellowing of the empounded herds</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Rose round the walls, and through the bronze-ringed door</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Jostled and shouted those war-wasted men,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And in the midst King Eochaid’s brother stood.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And bade all welcome, being ignorant.</span>

					<span>King Guari walked amid his court</span>

					<span>And there to three old beggars said:</span>

					<span>“You that have wandered far and wide</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Can ravel out what’s in my head.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Do men who least desire get most,</span>

					<br/>
					<span>And what could make their muscles taut</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unless desire had made them so.”</span>

					<span>“If that be true as it seems true,</span>

					<span>One of you three is a rich man,</span>

					<span>The third: “I’ll hurry to the course</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Among the other gentlemen,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And lay it all upon a horse”;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The second: “I have thought again:</span>

					<br/>
					<span>One to another sighed and cried:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The exorbitant dreams of beggary,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That idleness had borne to pride,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sang through their teeth from noon to noon;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And when the second twilight brought</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The frenzy of the beggars’ moon</span>
					<br/>
					<span>None closed his blood-shot eyes but sought</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To keep his fellows from their sleep;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All shouted till their anger grew</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And they were whirling in a heap.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>They mauled and bit the whole night through;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They mauled and bit till the day shone;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They mauled and bit through all that day</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And till another night had gone,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or if they made a moment’s stay</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They sat upon their heels to rail,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And when old Guari came and stood</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Before the three to end this tale,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They were commingling lice and blood.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Time’s up,” he cried, and all the three</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With blood-shot eyes upon him stared.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Time’s up,” he cried, and all the three</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Fell down upon the dust and snored.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Maybe I shall be lucky yet,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now they are silent,” said the crane.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Though to my feathers in the wet</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I’ve stood as I were made of stone</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And seen the rubbish run about,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It’s certain there are trout somewhere</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And maybe I shall take a trout</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If but I do not seem to care.”</span>

					<span>Three old hermits took the air</span>

					<span>By a cold and desolate sea,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>First was muttering a prayer,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Second rummaged for a flea;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On a windy stone, the third,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Giddy with his hundredth year,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sang unnoticed like a bird.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Though the Door of Death is near</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And what waits behind the door,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Three times in a single day</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I, though upright on the shore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Fall asleep when I should pray.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So the first but now the second,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“We’re but given what we have earned</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When all thoughts and deeds are reckoned,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So it’s plain to be discerned</span>

					<br/>
					<span>Moaned the other, “They are thrown</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Into some most fearful shape.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But the second mocked his moan:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“They are not changed to anything,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Having loved God once, but maybe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To a poet or a king</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or a witty lovely lady.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>While he’d rummaged rags and hair,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Caught and cracked his flea, the third,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Giddy with his hundredth year</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sang unnoticed like a bird.</span>

				<h3 epub:type="title">The Hour Before Dawn</h3>
				<p>
					<span>A cursing rogue with a merry face,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A bundle of rags upon a crutch,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Stumbled upon that windy place</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Called Croghan, and it was as much</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As the one sturdy leg could do</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To keep him upright while he cursed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He had counted, where long years ago</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Queen Maeve’s nine Maines had been nursed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A pair of lapwings, one old sheep</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And not a house to the plain’s edge,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When close to his right hand a heap</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of grey stones and a rocky ledge</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Reminded him that he could make,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If he but shifted a few stones,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A shelter till the daylight broke.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But while he fumbled with the stones</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They toppled over; “Were it not</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I have a lucky wooden shin</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I had been hurt”; and toppling brought</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Before his eyes, where stones had been,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A dark deep hollow in the rock.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He gave a gasp and thought to have fled,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Being certain it was no right rock</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Because an ancient history said</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hell Mouth lay open near that place,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And yet stood still, because inside</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A great lad with a beery face</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Had tucked himself away beside</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A ladle and a tub of beer,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And snored, no phantom by his look.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So with a laugh at his own fear</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He crawled into that pleasant nook.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Night grows uneasy near the dawn</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till even I sleep light; but who</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Has tired of his own company?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What one of Maeve’s nine brawling sons</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sick of his grave has wakened me?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But let him keep his grave for once</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That I may find the sleep I have lost.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“What care I if you sleep or wake,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But I’ll have no man call me ghost.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Say what you please, but from daybreak</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I’ll sleep another century.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“And I will talk before I sleep</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="dl2">
						<span>And drink before I talk.”</span>
						<span>And he</span>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Had dipped the wooden ladle deep</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Into the sleeper’s tub of beer</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Had not the sleeper started up.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Before you have dipped it in the beer</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I dragged from Goban’s mountain-top</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I’ll have assurance that you are able</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To value beer; no half-legged fool</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Shall dip his nose into my ladle</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Merely for stumbling on this hole</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In the bad hour before the dawn.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="dl2">
						<span>“Why, beer is only beer.”</span>
						<span>“But say</span>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>‘I’ll sleep until the winter’s gone,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or maybe to Midsummer Day,’</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And drink, and you will sleep that length.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“I’d like to sleep till winter’s gone</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or till the sun is in his strength.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This blast has chilled me to the bone.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“I had no better plan at first.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I thought to wait for that or this;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Because the weather was a-cursed</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or I had no woman there to kiss;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So slept for half a year or so;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But year by year I found that less</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Gave me such pleasure I’d forgo</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Even a half hour’s nothingness,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And when at one year’s end I found</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I had not waked a single minute,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I chose this burrow under ground.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I’ll sleep away all Time within it:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My sleep were now nine centuries</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But for those mornings when I find</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The lapwing at their foolish cries</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the sheep bleating at the wind</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As when I also played the fool.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The beggar in a rage began</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon his hunkers in the hole,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“It’s plain that you are no right man</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To mock at everything I love</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As if it were not worth the doing.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I’d have a merry life enough</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If a good Easter wind were blowing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And though the winter wind is bad</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I should not be too down in the mouth</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For anything you did or said</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If but this wind were in the south.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“You cry aloud, O would ’twere spring</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or that the wind would shift a point</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And do not know that you would bring,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If time were suppler in the joint,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Neither the spring nor the south wind</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But the hour when you shall pass away</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And leave no smoking wick behind,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For all life longs for the Last Day</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And there’s no man but cocks his ear</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To know when Michael’s trumpet cries</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That flesh and bone may disappear,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And souls as if they were but sighs,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And there be nothing but God left;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But I alone being blessed keep</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Like some old rabbit to my cleft</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And wait Him in a drunken sleep.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He dipped his ladle in the tub</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And drank and yawned and stretched him out.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The other shouted, “You would rob</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My life of every pleasant thought</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And every comfortable thing</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And so take that and that.” Thereon</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He gave him a great pummelling,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But might have pummelled at a stone</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For all the sleeper knew or cared;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And after heaped up stone on stone,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And then, grown weary, prayed and cursed</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And heaped up stone on stone again,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And prayed and cursed and cursed and fled</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From Maeve and all that juggling plain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor gave God thanks till overhead</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The clouds were brightening with the dawn.</span>

				<p>This book is, in part, a reprint of <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">The Wild Swans at Coole</i>, printed a year ago on my sister’s hand-press at Dundrum, <abbr>Co.</abbr> Dublin. I have not, however, reprinted a play which may be a part of a book of new plays suggested by the dance plays of Japan, and I have added a number of new poems. Michael Robartes and John Aherne, whose names occur in one or other of these, are characters in some stories I wrote years ago, who have once again become a part of the phantasmagoria through which I can alone express my convictions about the world. I have the fancy that I read the name John Aherne among those of men prosecuted for making a disturbance at the first production of “The Play Boy,” which may account for his animosity to myself.</p>

				<p>
					<span>This night has been so strange that it seemed</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As if the hair stood up on my head.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From going-down of the sun I have dreamed</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That women laughing, or timid or wild,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In rustle of lace or silken stuff,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Climbed up my creaking stair. They had read</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All I had rhymed of that monstrous thing</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Returned and yet unrequited love.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They stood in the door and stood between</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My great wood lectern and the fire</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till I could hear their hearts beating:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>One is a harlot, and one a child</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That never looked upon man with desire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And one it may be a queen.</span>

					<span>Five-and-twenty years have gone</span>

					<span>In that tomb by him and her,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His son George, the astrologer;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And Masons drove from miles away</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To scatter the Acacia spray</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon a melancholy man</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who had ended where his breath began.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Many a son and daughter lies</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Far from the customary skies,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Mall and Eades’s grammar school,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In London or in Liverpool;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But where is laid the sailor John?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That so many lands had known:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Quiet lands or unquiet seas</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where the Indians trade or Japanese.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He never found his rest ashore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Moping for one voyage more.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where have they laid the sailor John?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And yesterday the youngest son,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A humorous, unambitious man,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was buried near the astrologer;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And are we now in the tenth year?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Since he, who had been contented long,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A nobody in a great throng,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Decided he would journey home,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now that his fiftieth year had come,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And “<abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Alfred” be again</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon the lips of common men</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who carried in their memory</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His childhood and his family.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>At all these death-beds women heard</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A visionary white sea-bird</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lamenting that a man should die;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And with that cry I have raised my cry.</span>

					<p>
						<span>One lashed her tail; her eyes lit by the moon</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Gazed upon all things known, all things unknown,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In triumph of intellect</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With motionless head erect.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>That other’s moonlit eyeballs never moved,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Being fixed on all things loved, all things unloved,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Yet little peace he had</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For those that love are sad.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Oh, little did they care who danced between,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And little she by whom her dance was seen</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So that she danced. No thought,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Body perfection brought,</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>For what but eye and ear silence the mind</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With the minute particulars of mankind?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Mind moved yet seemed to stop</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As ’twere a spinning-top.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>In contemplation had those three so wrought</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon a moment, and so stretched it out</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That they, time overthrown,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Were dead yet flesh and bone.</span>

				<h3 epub:type="title">Preface to Michael Robartes and the Dancer</h3>
				<p>A few of these poems may be difficult to understand, perhaps more difficult than I know. Goethe has said that the poet needs all philosophy, but that he must keep it out of his work. After the first few poems I came into possession of Michael Robartes’ exposition of the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book" xml:lang="la">Speculum Angelorum et Hominum</i> of Geraldus, and in the excitement of arranging and editing could no more keep out philosophy than could Goethe himself at certain periods of his life. I have tried to make understanding easy by a couple of notes, which are at any rate much shorter than those Dante wrote on certain of his odes in the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book" xml:lang="la">Convito</i>, but I may not have succeeded. It is hard for a writer, who has spent much labour upon his style, to remember that thought, which seems to him natural and logical like that style, may be unintelligible to others. The first excitement over, and the thought changed into settled conviction, his interest in simple, that is to say in normal emotion, is always I think increased; he is no longer looking for candlestick and matches but at the objects in the room.</p>
				<p>I have given no account of Robartes himself, nor of his discovery of the explanation of Geraldus’ diagrams and pictures in the traditional knowledge of a certain obscure Arab tribe, for I hope that my selection from the great mass of his letters and table talk, which I owe to his friend John Aherne, may be published before, or at any rate but soon after this little book, which, like all hand-printed books will take a long time for the setting up and printing off and for the drying of the pages.</p>

					<span>And thus declared that Arab lady:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Last night, where under the wild moon</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On grassy mattress I had laid me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Within my arms great Solomon,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I suddenly cried out in a strange tongue</span>

					<span class="dl2">
						<span>Not his, not mine.”</span>
						<span>Who understood</span>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What ever had been said, sighed, sung,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Howled, miau-d, barked, brayed, belled, yelled, cried, crowed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thereon explained: “A cockerel</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Cried from a blossoming apple bough</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Three hundred years before the Fall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And never crew again till now,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And would not now but that he thought,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Chance being at one with Choice at last,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All that the brigand apple brought</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And this foul world were dead at last.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He that crowed out eternity</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thought to have crowed it in again.</span>

					<span>For though love has a spider’s eye</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To find out some appropriate pain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Aye, though all passion’s in the glance,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For every nerve: and tests a lover</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With cruelties of Choice and Chance;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And when at last that murder’s over</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Maybe the bride-bed brings despair</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For each an imagined image brings</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And finds a real image there;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet the world ends when these two things,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Though several, are a single light,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When oil and wick are burned in one;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Therefore a blessed moon last night</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Gave Sheba to her Solomon.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="dl2">
						<span>“Yet the world stays”:</span>
						<span>“If that be so,</span>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Your cockerel found us in the wrong</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Although he thought it worth a crow.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Maybe an image is too strong</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or maybe is not strong enough.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“The night has fallen; not a sound</span>

					<span>In the forbidden sacred grove</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unless a petal hit the ground,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor any human sight within it</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But the crushed grass where we have lain;</span>

				<p>
					<span>Too long a sacrifice</span>

					<span>She that but little patience knew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From childhood on, had now so much</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A grey gull lost its fear and flew</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Down to her cell and there alit,</span>

					<span>And there endured her fingers’ touch</span>

					<span>With all youth’s lonely wildness stirred,</span>

				<p>
					<span>Was it the double of my dream</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The woman that by me lay</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Dreamed, or did we halve a dream</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Under the first cold gleam of day?</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I thought “there is a waterfall</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon Ben Bulben side,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That all my childhood counted dear;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Were I to travel far and wide</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I could not find a thing so dear.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My memories had magnified</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So many times childish delight.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I would have touched it like a child</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But knew my finger could but have touched</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Cold stone and water. I grew wild</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Even accusing heaven because</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It had set down among its laws:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nothing that we love over-much</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Is ponderable to our touch.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I dreamed towards break of day,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The cold blown spray in my nostril.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But she that beside me lay</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Had watched in bitterer sleep</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The marvellous stag of Arthur,</span>

				<p>
					<span>For certain minutes at the least</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That crafty demon and that loud beast</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That plague me day and night</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ran out of my sight;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Though I had long pernned in the gyre,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Between my hatred and desire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I saw my freedom won</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And all laugh in the sun.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The glittering eyes in a death’s head</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of old Luke Wadding’s portrait said</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Welcome, and the Ormonds all</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nodded upon the wall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And even Stafford smiled as though</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It made him happier to know</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I understood his plan.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now that the loud beast ran</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There was no portrait in the Gallery</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But beckoned to sweet company,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For all men’s thoughts grew clear</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Being dear as mine are dear.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But soon a tear-drop started up</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For aimless joy had made me stop</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Beside the little lake</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To watch a white gull take</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A bit of bread thrown up into the air;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now gyring down and pernning there</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He splashed where an absurd</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Portly green-pated bird</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Shook off the water from his back;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Being no more demoniac</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A stupid happy creature</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Could rouse my whole nature.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Yet I am certain as can be</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That every natural victory</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Belongs to beast or demon,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That never yet had freeman</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Right mastery of natural things,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And that mere growing old, that brings</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Chilled blood, this sweetness brought;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet have no dearer thought</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Than that I may find out a way</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To make it linger half a day.</span>

				<p>
					<span>O what a sweetness strayed</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Through barren Thebaid,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or by the Mareotic sea</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When that exultant Anthony</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And twice a thousand more</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Starved upon the shore</span>

				<h3 epub:type="title">A Prayer for My Daughter</h3>
				<p>
					<span>Once more the storm is howling and half hid</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Under this cradle-hood and coverlid</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My child sleeps on. There is no obstacle</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But Gregory’s wood and one bare hill</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whereby the haystack and roof-levelling wind,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Bred on the Atlantic, can be stayed;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And for an hour I have walked and prayed</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Because of the great gloom that is in my mind.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I have walked and prayed for this young child an hour</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And heard the sea-wind scream upon the tower,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And under the arches of the bridge, and scream</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In the elms above the flooded stream;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Imagining in excited reverie</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That the future years had come,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Dancing to a frenzied drum,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Out of the murderous innocence of the sea.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>May she be granted beauty and yet not</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Beauty to make a stranger’s eye distraught,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or hers before a looking-glass, for such,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Being made beautiful overmuch,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Consider beauty a sufficient end,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lose natural kindness and maybe</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The heart-revealing intimacy</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That chooses right and never find a friend.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Helen being chosen found life flat and dull</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And later had much trouble from a fool,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>While that great Queen, that rose out of the spray,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Being fatherless could have her way</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet chose a bandy-legged smith for man.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It’s certain that fine women eat</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A crazy salad with their meat</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whereby the Horn of Plenty is undone.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>In courtesy I’d have her chiefly learned;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hearts are not had as a gift but hearts are earned</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By those that are not entirely beautiful;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet many, that have played the fool</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For beauty’s very self, has charm made wise,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And many a poor man that has roved,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Loved and thought himself beloved,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From a glad kindness cannot take his eyes.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>May she become a flourishing hidden tree</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That all her thoughts may like the linnet be,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And have no business but dispensing round</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Their magnanimities of sound,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor but in merriment begin a chase,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor but in merriment a quarrel.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Oh, may she live like some green laurel</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Rooted in one dear perpetual place.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>My mind, because the minds that I have loved,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The sort of beauty that I have approved,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Prosper but little, has dried up of late,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet knows that to be choked with hate</span>
					<br/>
					<span>May well be of all evil chances chief.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If there’s no hatred in a mind</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Assault and battery of the wind</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Can never tear the linnet from the leaf.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>An intellectual hatred is the worst,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So let her think opinions are accursed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Have I not seen the loveliest woman born</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Out of the mouth of Plenty’s horn,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Because of her opinionated mind</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Barter that horn and every good</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By quiet natures understood</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For an old bellows full of angry wind?</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Considering that, all hatred driven hence,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The soul recovers radical innocence</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And learns at last that it is self-delighting,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Self-appeasing, self-affrighting.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And that its own sweet will is heaven’s will;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She can, though every face should scowl</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And every windy quarter howl</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or every bellows burst, be happy still.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And may her bride-groom bring her to a house</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where all’s accustomed, ceremonious;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For arrogance and hatred are the wares</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Peddled in the thoroughfares.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How but in custom and in ceremony</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Are innocence and beauty born?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ceremony’s a name for the rich horn,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And custom for the spreading laurel tree.</span>

						<span>What shall I do with this absurdity⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>O heart, O troubled heart⁠—this caricature,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Decrepit age that has been tied to me</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="dl2">
							<span>As to a dog’s tail?</span>

						<br/>
						<span>That more expected the impossible⁠—</span>

						<span>No, not in boyhood when with rod and fly,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or the humbler worm, I climbed Ben Bulben’s back</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And had the livelong summer day to spend.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It seems that I must bid the Muse go pack,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Choose Plato and Plotinus for a friend</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Until imagination, ear and eye,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Can be content with argument and deal</span>

						<span>I pace upon the battlements and stare</span>
						<br/>
						<span>On the foundations of a house, or where</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Tree, like a sooty finger, starts from the earth;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And send imagination forth</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Under the day’s declining beam, and call</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Images and memories</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From ruin or from ancient trees,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For I would ask a question of them all.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Beyond that ridge lived <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> French, and once</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When every silver candlestick or sconce</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Lit up the dark mahogany and the wine,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A serving man that could divine</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That most respected lady’s every wish,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Ran and with the garden shears</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Clipped an insolent farmer’s ears</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And brought them in a little covered dish.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Some few remembered still when I was young</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A peasant girl commended by a song,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Who’d lived somewhere upon that rocky place,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And praised the colour of her face,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And had the greater joy in praising her,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Remembering that, if walked she there,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Farmers jostled at the fair</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So great a glory did the song confer.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>And certain men, being maddened by those rhymes,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or else by toasting her a score of times,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Rose from the table and declared it right</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To test their fancy by their sight;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But they mistook the brightness of the moon</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For the prosaic light of day⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Music had driven their wits astray⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And one was drowned in the great bog of Cloone.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Strange, but the man who made the song was blind,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Yet, now I have considered it, I find</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That nothing strange; the tragedy began</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With Homer that was a blind man,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And Helen has all living hearts betrayed.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>O may the moon and sunlight seem</span>
						<br/>
						<span>One inextricable beam,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For if I triumph I must make men mad.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>And I myself created Hanrahan</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And drove him drunk or sober through the dawn</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From somewhere in the neighbouring cottages.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Caught by an old man’s juggleries</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He stumbled, tumbled, fumbled to and fro</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And had but broken knees for hire</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And horrible splendour of desire;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I thought it all out twenty years ago:</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Good fellows shuffled cards in an old bawn;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And when that ancient ruffian’s turn was on</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He so bewitched the cards under his thumb</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That all, but the one card, became</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A pack of hounds and not a pack of cards,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And that he changed into a hare.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Hanrahan rose in frenzy there</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And followed up those baying creatures towards⁠—</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>O towards I have forgotten what⁠—enough!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I must recall a man that neither love</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor music nor an enemy’s clipped ear</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Could, he was so harried, cheer;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A figure that has grown so fabulous</span>
						<br/>
						<span>There’s not a neighbour left to say</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When he finished his dog’s day:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>An ancient bankrupt master of this house.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Before that ruin came, for centuries,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Rough men-at-arms, cross-gartered to the knees</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or shod in iron, climbed the narrow stairs,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And certain men-at-arms there were</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Whose images, in the Great Memory stored,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Come with loud cry and panting breast</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To break upon a sleeper’s rest</span>
						<br/>
						<span>While their great wooden dice beat on the board.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>As I would question all, come all who can;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Come old, necessitous, half-mounted man;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And bring beauty’s blind rambling celebrant;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The red man the juggler sent</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Through God-forsaken meadows; <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> French,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Gifted with so fine an ear;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The man drowned in a bog’s mire,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When mocking muses chose the country wench.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Did all old men and women, rich and poor,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Who trod upon these rocks or passed this door,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Whether in public or in secret rage</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As I do now against old age?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But I have found an answer in those eyes</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That are impatient to be gone;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Go therefore; but leave Hanrahan</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For I need all his mighty memories.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Old lecher with a love on every wind</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Bring up out of that deep considering mind</span>
						<br/>
						<span>All that you have discovered in the grave,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For it is certain that you have</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Reckoned up every unforeknown, unseeing</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Plunge, lured by a softening eye,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or by a touch or a sigh,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Into the labyrinth of another’s being;</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Does the imagination dwell the most</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon a woman won or woman lost?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>If on the lost, admit you turned aside</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From a great labyrinth out of pride,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Cowardice, some silly over-subtle thought</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or anything called conscience once;</span>

						<span>And that if memory recur, the sun’s</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Under eclipse and the day blotted out.</span>

						<span>It is time that I wrote my will;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I choose upstanding men,</span>

						<span>That climb the streams until</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The fountain leap, and at dawn</span>

						<span>Drop their cast at the side</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of dripping stone; I declare</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They shall inherit my pride,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The pride of people that were</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Bound neither to Cause nor to State,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Neither to slaves that were spat on,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor to the tyrants that spat,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The people of Burke and of Grattan</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That gave, though free to refuse⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Pride, like that of the morn,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When the headlong light is loose,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or that of the fabulous horn,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or that of the sudden shower</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When all streams are dry,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or that of the hour</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When the swan must fix his eye</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon a fading gleam,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Float out upon a long</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Last reach of glittering stream</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And there sing his last song.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And I declare my faith;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I mock Plotinus’ thought</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And cry in Plato’s teeth,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Death and life were not</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Till man made up the whole,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Made lock, stock and barrel</span>

						<span>Out of his bitter soul,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Aye, sun and moon and star, all,</span>

						<span>That, being dead, we rise,</span>

						<span>Dream and so create</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Translunar Paradise.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I have prepared my peace</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With learned Italian things</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And the proud stones of Greece,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Poet’s imaginings</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And memories of love,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Memories of the words of women,</span>

						<span>All those things whereof</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Man makes a superhuman,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Mirror-resembling dream.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>As at the loophole there,</span>

						<span>The daws chatter and scream,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And drop twigs layer upon layer.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When they have mounted up,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The mother bird will rest</span>
						<br/>
						<span>On their hollow top,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And so warm her wild nest.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>I leave both faith and pride</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To young upstanding men</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Climbing the mountain side,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That under bursting dawn</span>

						<span>They may drop a fly;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Being of that metal made</span>

						<span>Now shall I make my soul</span>

						<span>In a learned school</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Till the wreck of body,</span>

						<span>Slow decay of blood,</span>

						<span>Testy delirium</span>

						<span>Of every brilliant eye</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That made a catch in the breath⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Seem but the clouds of the sky</span>

						<span>When the horizon fades;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or a bird’s sleepy cry</span>

						<span>Among the deepening shades.</span>

						<span>Surely among a rich man’s flowering lawns,</span>

						<span>Life overflows without ambitious pains;</span>

					<span>Kusta ben Luka is my name, I write</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To Abd al-Rabban; fellow roysterer once,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now the good Caliph’s learned Treasurer,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="dl2">
						<span>And for no ear but his.</span>
						<span>Carry this letter</span>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Through the great gallery of the Treasure House</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where banners of the Caliphs hang, night-coloured</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But brilliant as the night’s embroidery,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And wait war’s music; pass the little gallery;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Pass books of learning from Byzantium</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Written in gold upon a purple stain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And pause at last, I was about to say,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>At the great book of Sappho’s song; but no,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For should you leave my letter there, a boy’s</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Love-lorn, indifferent hands might come upon it</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And let it fall unnoticed to the floor.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Pause at the Treatise of Parmenides</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And hide it there, for Caliphs to world’s end</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Must keep that perfect, as they keep her song</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="dl2">
						<span>So great its fame.</span>
						<span>When fitting time has passed</span>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The parchment will disclose to some learned man</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A mystery that else had found no chronicler</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But the wild Bedouin. Though I approve</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Those wanderers that welcomed in their tents</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What great Harun al-Rashid, occupied</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With Persian embassy or Grecian war,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Must needs neglect; I cannot hide the truth</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That wandering in a desert, featureless</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As air under a wing, can give birds’ wit.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In after time they will speak much of me</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And speak but fantasy. Recall the year</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When our beloved Caliph put to death</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His Vizir Jaffer for an unknown reason;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“If but the shirt upon my body knew it</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I’d tear it off and throw it in the fire.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That speech was all that the town knew, but he</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Seemed for a while to have grown young again;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Seemed so on purpose, muttered Jaffer’s friends,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That none might know that he was conscience struck⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But that’s a traitor’s thought. Enough for me</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That in the early summer of the year</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The mightiest of the princes of the world</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Came to the least considered of his courtiers;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sat down upon the fountain’s marble edge</span>
					<br/>
					<span>One hand amid the goldfish in the pool;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And thereupon a colloquy took place</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That I commend to all the chroniclers</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To show how violent great hearts can lose</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Their bitterness and find the honey-comb.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“I have brought a slender bride into the house;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>You know the saying ‘Change the bride with Spring,’</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And she and I, being sunk in happiness,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Cannot endure to think you tread these paths,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When evening stirs the jasmine, and yet</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="dl2">
						<span>Are brideless.”</span>
						<span>“I am falling into years.”</span>
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“But such as you and I do not seem old</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Like men who live by habit. Every day</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I ride with falcon to the river’s edge</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or carry the ringed mail upon my back,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or court a woman; neither enemy,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Game-bird, nor woman does the same thing twice;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And so a hunter carries in the eye</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A mimicry of youth. Can poet’s thought</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That springs from body and in body falls</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Like this pure jet, now lost amid blue sky</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now bathing lily leaf and fishes’ scale,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="dl2">
						<span>Be mimicry?”</span>
						<span>“What matter if our souls</span>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Are nearer to the surface of the body</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Than souls that start no game and turn no rhyme!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The soul’s own youth and not the body’s youth</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Shows through our lineaments. My candle’s bright,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My lantern is too loyal not to show</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That it was made in your great father’s reign.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“And yet the jasmine season warms our blood.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Great prince, forgive the freedom of my speech;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>You think that love has seasons, and you think</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That if the spring bear off what the spring gave</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The heart need suffer no defeat; but I</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who have accepted the Byzantine faith,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That seems unnatural to Arabian minds,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Think when I choose a bride I choose for ever;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And if her eye should not grow bright for mine</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or brighten only for some younger eye,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My heart could never turn from daily ruin,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="dl2">
						<span>Nor find a remedy.”</span>
						<span>“But what if I</span>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Have lit upon a woman, who so shares</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Your thirst for those old crabbed mysteries,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So strains to look beyond our life, an eye</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That never knew that strain would scarce seem bright,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And yet herself can seem youth’s very fountain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="dl2">
						<span>Being all brimmed with life.”</span>
						<span>“Were it but true</span>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I would have found the best that life can give,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Companionship in those mysterious things</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That make a man’s soul or a woman’s soul</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="dl2">
						<span>Itself and not some other soul.”</span>
						<span>“That love</span>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Must needs be in this life and in what follows</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unchanging and at peace, and it is right</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Every philosopher should praise that love.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But I being none can praise its opposite.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It makes my passion stronger but to think</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Like passion stirs the peacock and his mate,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The wild stag and the doe; that mouth to mouth</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Is a man’s mockery of the changeless soul.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And thereupon his bounty gave what now</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Can shake more blossom from autumnal chill</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Than all my bursting springtime knew. A girl</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Perched in some window of her mother’s house</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Had watched my daily passage to and fro;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Had heard impossible history of my past;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Imagined some impossible history</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lived at my side; thought time’s disfiguring touch</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Gave but more reason for a woman’s care.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet was it love of me, or was it love</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of the stark mystery that has dazed my sight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Perplexed her fantasy and planned her care?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or did the torchlight of that mystery</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Pick out my features in such light and shade</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Two contemplating passions chose one theme</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Through sheer bewilderment? She had not paced</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The garden paths, nor counted up the rooms,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Before she had spread a book upon her knees</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And asked about the pictures or the text;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And often those first days I saw her stare</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On old dry writing in a learned tongue,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On old dry faggots that could never please</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The extravagance of spring; or move a hand</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As if that writing or the figured page</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="dl2">
						<span>Were some dear cheek.</span>
						<span>Upon a moonless night</span>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I sat where I could watch her sleeping form,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And wrote by candle-light; but her form moved,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And fearing that my light disturbed her sleep</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I rose that I might screen it with a cloth.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I heard her voice, “Turn that I may expound</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What’s bowed your shoulder and made pale your cheek”;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And saw her sitting upright on the bed;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or was it she that spoke or some great Djinn?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I say that a Djinn spoke. A live-long hour</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She seemed the learned man and I the child;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Truths without father came, truths that no book</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of all the uncounted books that I have read,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor thought out of her mind or mine begot,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Self-born, high-born, and solitary truths,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Those terrible implacable straight lines</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Drawn through the wandering vegetative dream,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Even those truths that when my bones are dust</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="dl2">
						<span>Must drive the Arabian host.</span>
						<span>The voice grew still,</span>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And she lay down upon her bed and slept,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But woke at the first gleam of day, rose up</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And swept the house and sang about her work</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In childish ignorance of all that passed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A dozen nights of natural sleep, and then</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When the full moon swam to its greatest height</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She rose, and with her eyes shut fast in sleep</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Walked through the house. Unnoticed and unfelt</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I wrapped her in a heavy hooded cloak, and she,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Half running, dropped at the first ridge of the desert</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And there marked out those emblems on the sand</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That day by day I study and marvel at,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With her white finger. I led her home asleep</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And once again she rose and swept the house</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In childish ignorance of all that passed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Even to-day, after some seven years</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When maybe thrice in every moon her mouth</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Murmured the wisdom of the desert Djinns,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She keeps that ignorance, nor has she now</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That first unnatural interest in my books.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It seems enough that I am there; and yet</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Old fellow student, whose most patient ear</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Heard all the anxiety of my passionate youth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It seems I must buy knowledge with my peace.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What if she lose her ignorance and so</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Dream that I love her only for the voice,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That every gift and every word of praise</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Is but a payment for that midnight voice</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That is to age what milk is to a child!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Were she to lose her love, because she had lost</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her confidence in mine, or even lose</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Its first simplicity, love, voice and all,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All my fine feathers would be plucked away</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I left shivering. The voice has drawn</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A quality of wisdom from her love’s</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Particular quality. The signs and shapes;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All those abstractions that you fancied were</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From the great treatise of Parmenides;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All, all those gyres and cubes and midnight things</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Are but a new expression of her body</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Drunk with the bitter sweetness of her youth.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And now my utmost mystery is out.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A woman’s beauty is a storm-tossed banner;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Under it wisdom stands, and I alone⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of all Arabia’s lovers I alone⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor dazzled by the embroidery, nor lost</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In the confusion of its night-dark folds,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Can hear the armed man speak.</span>

					<span>To drink from the wine-breath</span>

					<span>H⁠⸺’s the first I call. He loved strange thought</span>

					<br/>
					<span>And that to such a pitch of passion wrought</span>

					<span>Nothing could bring him, when his lady died,</span>

					<span>Words were but wasted breath;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>One dear hope had he:</span>

					<span>The inclemency</span>

					<span>Of that or the next winter would be death.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Two thoughts were so mixed up I could not tell</span>

					<span>Whether of her or God he thought the most,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But think that his mind’s eye,</span>

					<br/>
					<span>And that a slight companionable ghost,</span>

					<span>Wild with divinity,</span>

					<span>With ’minished beauty, multiplied commonplace,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Preferred to teach a school,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Away from neighbour or friend</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Among dark skins, and there</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Permit foul years to wear</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hidden from eyesight to the unnoticed end.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Before that end much had she ravelled out</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From a discourse in figurative speech</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By some learned Indian</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On the soul’s journey. How it is whirled about,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Wherever the orbit of the moon can reach,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Until it plunge into the sun;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And there, free and yet fast</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Being both Chance and Choice,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Forget its broken toys</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And sink into its own delight at last.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And I call up MacGregor from the grave,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For in my first hard springtime we were friends,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Although of late estranged.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I thought him half a lunatic, half knave,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And told him so, but friendship never ends;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And what if mind seem changed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And it seem changed with the mind,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When thoughts rise up unbid</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On generous things that he did</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I grow half contented to be blind.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>He had much industry at setting out,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Much boisterous courage, before loneliness</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Had driven him crazed;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For meditations upon unknown thought</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Make human intercourse grow less and less;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They are neither paid nor praised.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But he’d object to the host,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The glass because my glass;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A ghost-lover he was</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And may have grown more arrogant being a ghost.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But names are nothing. What matter who it be,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So that his elements have grown so fine</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The fume of muscatel</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Can give his sharpened palate ecstasy</span>
					<br/>
					<span>No living man can drink from the whole wine.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I have mummy truths to tell</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whereat the living mock,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Though not for sober ear,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For maybe all that hear</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Should laugh and weep an hour upon the clock.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Such thought⁠—such thought have I that hold it tight</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till meditation master all its parts,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nothing can stay my glance</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Until that glance run in the world’s despite</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To where the damned have howled away their hearts,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And where the blessed dance;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Such thought, that in it bound</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I need no other thing</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Wound in mind’s wandering,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As mummies in the mummy-cloth are wound.</span>
