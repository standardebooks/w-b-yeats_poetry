					<p>The poem is founded upon the middle Irish dialogues of S. Patric and Usheen and a certain Gaelic poem of the last century. The events it describes are supposed to have taken place rather in the indefinite period, made up of many periods, described by the folktales, than in any particular century; it therefore, like the later Fenian stories themselves, mixes much that is medieval with much that is ancient. The Gaelic poems do not make Usheen go to more than one island, but a story in <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Silva Gadelica</i> describes “four paradises,” an island to the north, an island to the west, an island to the south, and Adam’s paradise in the east. — <abbr epub:type="z3998:personal-name">W.

					<p>It is said that an enchanted tree grew once on the little lake-island of Innisfree, and that its berries were, according to one legend, poisonous to mortals, and according to another, able to endow them with more than mortal powers. Both legends say that the berries were the food of the <i xml:lang="ga">Tuatha de Danaan</i>, or faeries. Quicken is the old Irish name for the mountain ash. The Dark Joan mentioned in the last verse is a famous faery who often goes about the roads disguised as a clutch of chickens. Niam is the famous and beautiful faery who carried Oisin into Faeryland. <i xml:lang="ga">Aslauga Shee</i> means faery host. <a href="poetry.xhtml#noteref-2" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p><strong>Ballads and Lyrics, “The Rose,” “The Wanderings of Oisin.”</strong>⁠—When I first wrote I went here and there for my subjects as my reading led me, and preferred to all other countries Arcadia and the India of romance, but presently I convinced myself, for such reasons as those in “<span epub:type="se:name.publication.essay">Ireland and the Arts</span>,” that I should never go for the scenery of a poem to any country but my own, and I think that I shall hold to that conviction to the end. I was very young; and, perhaps because I belonged to a Young Ireland Society in Dublin, I wished to be as easily understood as the Young Ireland writers, to write always out of the common thought of the people.</p>
					<p>I have put the poems written while I was influenced by this desire, though with an always lessening force, into those sections which I have called “Early Poems.” I read certain of them now with no little discontent, for I find, especially in the ballads, some triviality and sentimentality. Mangan and Davis, at their best, are not sentimental and trivial, but I became so from an imitation that was not natural to me. When I was writing the poems in the second of the three, the section called “The Rose,” I found that I was becoming unintelligible to the young men who had been in my thought. We have still the same tradition, but I have been like a traveller who, having when newly arrived in the city noticed nothing but the news of the marketplace, the songs of the workmen, the great public buildings, has come after certain months to let his thoughts run upon some little carving in its niche, some Ogham on a stone, or the conversation of a countryman who knows more of the “Boar without Bristles” than of the daily paper.</p>
					<p>When writing I went for nearly all my subjects to Irish folklore and legends, much as a Young Ireland poet would have done, writing “<span epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">Down by the Salley Garden</span>” by adding a few lines to a couple of lines I heard sung at Ballisodare; “<span epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">The Meditation of the Old Fisherman</span>” from the words of a not very old fisherman at Rosses Point; “<span epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">The Lamentation of the Old Pensioner</span>” from words spoken by a man on the Two Rock Mountain to a friend of mine; “<span epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">The Ballad of the Old Foxhunter</span>” from an incident in one of Kickham’s novels; and “<span epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">The Ballad of Moll Magee</span>” from a sermon preached in a chapel at Howth; and “<span epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">The Wanderings of Oisin</span>” from a Gaelic poem of the Eighteenth Century and certain Middle Irish poems in dialogue. It is no longer necessary to say who Oisin and Cuchulain and Fergus and the other bardic persons are, for Lady Gregory, in her <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Gods and Fighting Men</i> and <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Cuchulain of Muirthemne</i> has retold all that is greatest in the ancient literature of Ireland in a style that has to my ears an immortal beauty. <a href="poetry.xhtml#noteref-3" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p><strong>The Pronunciation of the Irish Names.</strong>⁠—I wrote the greater number of these poems I had hardly considered the question seriously. I copied at limes somebody’s perhaps fanciful phonetic spelling, and at times the ancient spelling as I found it in some literal translation, pronouncing the words always as they were spelt. I can only affirm that I did not even in my youth treat Irish names as badly as the medieval writers of the stories of King Arthur treated their Welsh names. <a href="poetry.xhtml#noteref-4" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>Many of the poems in Crossways, certainly those upon Indian subjects or upon shepherds and fauns, must have been written before I was twenty, for from the moment when I began “<span epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">The Wanderings of Usheen</span>,” which I did at that age, I believe, my subject matter became Irish. Every time I have reprinted them I have considered the leaving out of most, and then remembered an old school friend who has some of them by heart, for no better reason, as I think, than that they remind him of his own youth. The little Indian dramatic scene was meant to be the first scene of a play about a man loved by two women, who had the one soul between them, the one woman waking when the other slept, and knowing but daylight as the other only night. It came into my head when I saw a man at Rosses Point carrying two salmon. “One man with two souls,” I said, and added, “Oh, no, two people with one soul.” I am now once more in “A Vision” busy with that thought, the antitheses of day and of night and of moon and of sun. “The Rose” was part of my second book, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">The Countess Cathleen and Various Legends and Lyrics</i>, 1892, and I notice upon reading these poems for the first time for several years that the quality symbolized as The Rose differs from The Intellectual Beauty of Shelley and of Spencer in that I have imagined it as suffering with man and not as something pursued and seen from afar. It must have been a thought of my generation, for I remember the mystical painter Horton, whose work had little of his personal charm and real strangeness writing me these words, “I met your beloved in Russell Square, and she was weeping,” by which he meant that he had seen a vision of my neglected soul. I have altered several of these poems, “<span epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">Cuchulain’s Fight with the Waves</span>,” “<span epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">The Dedication to a Book of Stories</span>,” and “<span epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">To Ireland in the Coming Times</span>,” considerably, and “<span epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">The Song of the Old Pensioner</span>” and “<span epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">The Sorrow of Love</span>” till they are altogether new poems. Whatever changes I have made are but an attempt to express better what I thought and felt when I was a very young man. — <abbr epub:type="z3998:personal-name">W. B. Y.</abbr>, 1925.</p>
					<p>I here revised “<span epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">The Ballad of the Foxhunter</span>,” and once again “<span epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">Cuchulain’s Fight with the Sea</span>,” and “<span epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">The Dream of a Blessed Spirit</span>” I have renamed “<span epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">The Countess Cathleen in Paradise</span>,” as it was once part of this play and is so much rewritten that it is almost a new poem. — <abbr epub:type="z3998:personal-name">W.

					<p>This ballad is founded on the story of a certain Father O’Hart, priest of Coloony, Sligo, in the eighteenth century, as told by the man who was priest of Coloony in his <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">History of Ballisodare and Kilvarnet</i>. The robbery of the lands of Father O’Hart was a kind of robbery which occurred but rarely during the penal laws. Catholics, forbidden to own landed property, evaded the law by giving a Protestant nominal possession of their estates.

					<p>When I wrote these poems I had so meditated over the images that came to me in writing “Ballads and Lyrics,” “The Rose,” and “<span epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">The Wanderings of Oisin</span>,” and other images from Irish folklore, that they had become true symbols. I had sometimes when awake, but more often in sleep, moments of vision, a state very unlike dreaming, when these images took upon themselves what seemed an independent life and became a part of a mystic language, which seemed always as if it would bring me some strange revelation. Being troubled at what was thought a reckless obscurity, I tried to explain myself in lengthy notes, into which I put all the little learning I had, and more wilful fantasy than I now think admirable, though what is most mystical still seems to me the most true. I quote in what follows the better or the more necessary passages. <a href="poetry.xhtml#noteref-8" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p><strong>A Note on the Setting of these Poems to Music.</strong>⁠—A musician who would give me pleasure should not repeat a line, or put more than one note to one syllable.

					<p>The gods of ancient Ireland, the <i xml:lang="ga">Tuatha De Danaan</i>, or the Tribes of the goddess Danu, or the Sidhe, from <i xml:lang="ga">Aes Sidhe</i>, or <i xml:lang="ga">Sluagh Sidhe</i>, the people of the Faery Hills, as these words are usually explained, still ride the country as of old. <i xml:lang="ga">Sidhe</i> is also Gaelic for wind, and certainly the Sidhe have much to do with the wind. They journey in whirling wind, the winds that were called the dance of the daughters of Herodias in the Middle Ages, Herodias doubtless taking the place of some old goddess. When the country people see the leaves whirling on the road they bless themselves, because they believe the Sidhe to be passing by. They are almost always said to wear no covering upon their heads, and to let their hair stream out; and the great among them, for they have great and simple, go much upon horseback. If anyone becomes too much interested in them, and sees them overmuch, he loses all interest in ordinary things.</p>
					<p>A woman near Gort, in Galway, says: “There is a boy, now, of the Clorans; but I wouldn’t for the world let them think I spoke of him; it’s two years since he came from America, and since that time he never went to Mass, or to church, or to fairs, or to market, or to stand on the cross roads, or to hurling, or to nothing. And if anyone comes into the house, it’s into the room he’ll slip, not to see them; and as to work, he has the garden dug to bits, and the whole place smeared with cow dung; and such a crop as was never seen; and the alders all plaited till they look grand. One day he went as far as the chapel; but as soon as he got to the door he turned straight round again, as if he hadn’t power to pass it. I wonder he wouldn’t get the priest to read a Mass for him, or something; but the crop he has is grand, and you may know well he has some to help him.” One hears many stories of the kind; and a man whose son is believed to go out riding among them at night tells me that he is careless about everything, and lies in bed until it is late in the day. A doctor believes this boy to be mad. Those that are at times “away,” as it is called, know all things, but are afraid to speak. A countryman at Kiltartan says, “There was one of the Lydons⁠—John⁠—was away for seven years, lying in his bed, but brought away at nights, and he knew everything; and one, Kearney, up in the mountains, a cousin of his own, lost two hoggets, and came and told him, and he knew the very spot where they were, and told him, and he got them back again. But <em>they</em> were vexed at that, and took away the power, so that he never knew anything again, no more than another.”</p>
					<p>Knocknarea is in Sligo, and the country people say that Maeve, still a great queen of the western Sidhe, is buried in the cairn of stones upon it. I have written of Clooth-na-Bare in <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">The Celtic Twilight</i>. She “went all over the world, seeking a lake deep enough to drown her faery life, of which she had grown weary, leaping from hill to hill, and setting up a cairn of stones wherever her feet lighted, until, at last, she found the deepest water in the world in little Lough Ia, on the top of the bird mountain, in Sligo.” I forget, now, where I heard this story, but it may have been from a priest at Collooney. Clooth-na-Bare would mean the old woman of Bare, but is evidently a corruption of Cailleac Bare, the old woman of Bare, who, under the names Bare, and Berah, and Beri, and Verah, and Dera, and Dhira, appears in the legends of many places. <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> O’Grady found her haunting Lough Liath high up on the top of a mountain of the Fews, the Slieve Fuadh, or Slieve G-Cullain of old times, under the name of the Cailleac Buillia. He describes Lough Liath as a desolate moon-shaped lake, with made wells and sunken passages upon its borders, and beset by marsh and heather and gray boulders, and closes his “Flight of the Eagle” with a long rhapsody upon mountain and lake, because of the heroic tales and beautiful old myths that have hung about them always. He identifies the Cailleac Buillia with that Meluchra who persuaded Fionn to go to her amid the waters of Lough Liath, and so changed him with her enchantments, that, though she had to free him because of the threats of the Fiana, his hair was ever afterwards as white as snow. To this day the Tuatha De Danaan that are in the waters beckon to men, and drown them in the waters; and Bare, or Dhira, or Meluchra, or whatever name one likes the best, is, doubtless, the name of a mistress among them. Meluchra was daughter of Cullain; and Cullain <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> O’Grady calls, upon I know not what authority, a form of Lir, the master of waters. The people of the waters have been in all ages beautiful and changeable and lascivious, or beautiful and wise and lonely, for water is everywhere the signature of the fruitfulness of the body and of the fruitfulness of dreams. The white hair of Fionn may be but another of the troubles of those that come to unearthly wisdom and earthly trouble, and the threats and violence of the Fiana against her, a different form of the threats and violence the country people use, to make the Aes Sidhe give up those that are “away.” Bare is now often called an ugly old woman, but in the “Song of Bare,” which Lady Gregory has given in her <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Saints and Wonders</i>, she laments her lost beauty after the withering of seven hundred years; and <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Joyce says that one of her old names was Aebhin, which means beautiful. Aebhin was the goddess of the tribes of northern Leinster; and the lover she had made immortal, and who loved her perfectly, left her, and put on mortality, to fight among them against the stranger, and died on the strand of Clontarf. <a href="poetry.xhtml#noteref-10" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>Some writers distinguish between the <i xml:lang="ga">Sluagh Gaoith</i>, the host of the air, and <i xml:lang="ga">Sluagh Sidhe</i>, the host of the Sidhe, and describe the host of the air as of a peculiar malignancy. <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Joyce says, “Of all the different kinds of goblins⁠ ⁠… air demons were most dreaded by the people. They lived among clouds, and mists, and rocks, and hated the human race with the utmost malignity.” A very old Aran charm, which contains the words “Send God, by his strength, between us and the host of the Sidhe, between us and the host of the air,” seems also to distinguish among them. I am inclined, however, to think that the distinction came in with Christianity and its belief about the prince of the air, for the host of the Sidhe, as I have already explained, are closely associated with the wind.</p>
					<p>They are said to steal brides just after their marriage, and sometimes in a blast of wind. A man in Galway says, “At Aughanish there were two couples came to the shore to be married, and one of the newly married women was in the boat with the priest, and they going back to the island; and a sudden blast of wind came, and the priest said some blessed words that were able to save himself, but the girl was swept.”</p>
					<p>This woman was drowned; but more often the persons who are taken “get the touch,” as it is called, and fall into a half dream, and grow indifferent to all things, for their true life has gone out of the world, and is among the hills and the forts of the Sidhe. A faery doctor has told me that his wife “got the touch” at her marriage because there was one of them wanted her; and the way he knew for certain was, that when he took a pitchfork out of the rafters, and told her it was a broom, she said, “It is a broom.” She was, the truth is, in the magical sleep, to which people have given a new name lately, that makes the imagination so passive that it can be moulded by any voice in any world into any shape. A mere likeness of some old woman, or even old animal, some one or some thing the Sidhe have no longer a use for, is believed to be left instead of the person who is “away”; this some one or some thing can, it is thought, be driven away by threats, or by violence (though I have heard country women say that violence is wrong), which perhaps awakes the soul out of the magical sleep. The story in the poem is founded on an old Gaelic ballad that was sung and translated for me by a woman at Ballisodare in County Sligo; but in the ballad the husband found the keeners keening his wife when he got to his house. She was “swept” at once; but the Sidhe are said to value those the most whom they but cast into a half dream, which may last for years, for they need the help of a living person in most of the things they do. There are many stories of people who seem to die and be buried⁠—though the country people will tell you it is but some one or some thing put in their place that dies and is buried⁠—and yet are brought back afterwards. These tales are perhaps memories of true awakenings out of the magical sleep, moulded by the imagination, under the influence of a mystical doctrine which it understands too literally, into the shape of some well-known traditional tale. One does not hear them as one hears the others, from the persons who are “away,” or from their wives or husbands; and one old man, who had often seen the Sidhe, began one of them with “Maybe it is all vanity.”</p>
					<p>Here is a tale that a friend of mine heard in the Burren hills, and it is a type of all:⁠—</p>
					<p>“There was a girl to be married, and she didn’t like the man, and she cried when the day was coming, and said she wouldn’t go along with him. And the mother said, ‘Get into the bed, then, and I’ll say that you’re sick.’ And so she did. And when the man came the mother said to him, ‘You can’t get her, she’s sick in the bed.’ And he looked in and said, ‘That’s not my wife that’s in the bed, it’s some old hag.’ And the mother began to cry and roar. And he went out and got two hampers of turf, and made a fire, that they thought he was going to burn the house down. And when the fire was kindled, ‘Come out, now,’ says he, ‘and we’ll see who you are, when I’ll put you on the fire.’ And when she heard that, she gave one leap, and was out of the house, and they saw, then, it was an old hag she was. Well, the man asked the advice of an old woman, and she bid him go to a faery-bush that was near, and he might get some word of her. So he went there at night, and saw all sorts of grand people, and they in carriages or riding on horses, and among them he could see the girl he came to look for. So he went again to the old woman, and she said, ‘If you can get the three bits of blackthorn out of her hair, you’ll get her again.’ So that night he went again, and that time he only got hold of a bit of her hair. But the old woman told him that was no use, and that he was put back now, and it might be twelve nights before he’d get her. But on the fourth night he got the third bit of blackthorn, and he took her, and she came away with him. He never told the mother he had got her; but one day she saw her at a fair, and, says she, ‘That’s my daughter; I know her by the smile and by the laugh of her, and she with a shawl about her head.’ So the husband said, ‘You’re right there, and hard I worked to get her.’ She spoke often of the grand things she saw underground, and how she used to have wine to drink, and to drive out in a carriage with four horses every night. And she used to be able to see her husband when he came to look for her, and she was greatly afraid he’d get a drop of the wine, for then he would have come underground and never left it again. And she was glad herself to come to earth again, and not to be left there.”</p>
					<p>The old Gaelic literature is full of the appeals of the Tuatha De Danaan to mortals whom they would bring into their country; but the song of Midher to the beautiful Etain, the wife of the king who was called Echaid the ploughman, is the type of all.</p>
					<p>“O beautiful woman, come with me to the marvellous land where one listens to a sweet music, where one has spring flowers in one’s hair, where the body is like snow from head to foot, where no one is sad or silent, where teeth are white and eyebrows are black⁠ ⁠… cheeks red like foxglove in flower.⁠ ⁠… Ireland is beautiful, but not so beautiful as the Great Plain I call you to. The beer of Ireland is heady, but the beer of the Great Plain is much more heady. How marvellous is the country I am speaking of! Youth does not grow old there. Streams with warm flood flow there; sometimes mead, sometimes wine. Men are charming and without a blot there, and love is not forbidden there. O woman, when you come into my powerful country you will wear a crown of gold upon your head. I will give you the flesh of swine, and you will have beer and milk to drink, O beautiful woman. O beautiful woman, come with me!” <a href="poetry.xhtml#noteref-11" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>The Tuatha De Danaan can take all shapes, and those that are in the waters take often the shape of fish. A woman of Burren, in Galway, says, “There are more of them in the sea than on the land, and they sometimes try to come over the side of the boat in the form of fishes, for they can take their choice shape.” At other times they are beautiful women; and another Galway woman says, “Surely those things are in the sea as well as on land. My father was out fishing one night off Tyrone. And something came beside the boat that had eyes shining like candles. And then a wave came in, and a storm rose all in a minute, and whatever was in the wave, the weight of it had like to sink the boat. And then they saw that it was a woman in the sea that had the shining eyes. So my father went to the priest, and he bid him always to take a drop of holy water and a pinch of salt out in the boat with him, and nothing could harm him.”</p>
					<p>The poem was suggested to me by a Greek folk song; but the folk belief of Greece is very like that of Ireland, and I certainly thought, when I wrote it, of Ireland, and of the spirits that are in Ireland. An old man who was cutting a quickset hedge near Gort, in Galway, said, only the other day, “One time I was cutting timber over in Inchy, and about eight o’clock one morning, when I got there, I saw a girl picking nuts, with her hair hanging down over her shoulders; brown hair; and she had a good, clean face, and she was tall, and nothing on her head, and her dress no way gaudy, but simple. And when she felt me coming she gathered herself up, and was gone, as if the earth had swallowed her up. And I followed her, and looked for her, but I never could see her again from that day to this, never again.”</p>

					<p>My deer and hound are properly related to the deer and hound that flicker in and out of the various tellings of the Arthurian legends, leading different knights upon adventures, and to the hounds and to the hornless deer at the beginning of, I think, all tellings of Usheen’s journey to the country of the young. The hound is certainly related to the Hounds of Annwoyn or of Hades, who are white, and have red ears, and were heard, and are, perhaps, still heard by Welsh peasants, following some flying thing in the night winds; and is probably related to the hounds that Irish country people believe will awake and seize the souls of the dead if you lament them too loudly or too soon. An old woman told a friend and myself that she saw what she thought were white birds, flying over an enchanted place; but found, when she got near, that they had dogs’ heads, and I do not doubt that my hound and these dog-headed birds are of the same family. I got my hound and deer out of a last century Gaelic poem about Oisin’s journey to the country of the young. After the hunting of the hornless deer, that leads him to the seashore, and while he is riding over the sea with Niamh, he sees amid the waters⁠—I have not the Gaelic poem by me, and describe it from memory⁠—a young man following a girl who has a golden apple, and afterwards a hound with one red ear following a deer with no horns. This hound and this deer seem plain images of the desire of man “which is for the woman,” and “the desire of the woman which is for the desire of the man,” and of all desires that are as these. I have read them in this way in <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">The Wanderings of Usheen</i> or Oisin, and have made my lover sigh because he has seen in their faces “the immortal desire of immortals.”</p>
					<p>The man in my poem who has a hazel wand may have been Aengus, Master of Love; and I have made the boar without bristles come out of the West, because the place of sunset was in Ireland, as in other countries, a place of symbolic darkness and death. <a href="poetry.xhtml#noteref-13" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>I dreamed this story exactly as I have written it, and dreamed another long dream after it, trying to make out its meaning, and whether I was to write it in prose or verse. The first dream was more a vision than a dream, for it was beautiful and coherent, and gave me the sense of illumination and exaltation that one gets from visions, while the second dream was confused and meaningless. The poem has always meant a great deal to me, though, as is the way with symbolic poems, it has not always meant quite the same thing. Blake would have said, “the authors are in eternity,” and I am quite sure they can only be questioned in dreams. <a href="poetry.xhtml#noteref-14" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>All over Ireland there are prophecies of the coming rout of the enemies of Ireland, in a certain Valley of the Black Pig, and these prophecies are, no doubt, now, as they were in the Fenian days, a political force. I have heard of one man who would not give any money to the Land League, because the Battle could not be until the close of the century; but, as a rule, periods of trouble bring prophecies of its near coming. A few years before my time, an old man who lived at Lisadill, in Sligo, used to fall down in a fit and rave out descriptions of the Battle; and a man in Sligo has told me that it will be so great a battle that the horses shall go up to their fetlocks in blood, and that their girths, when it is over, will rot from their bellies for lack of a hand to unbuckle them. If one reads Professor Rhys’ <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Celtic Heathendom</i> by the light of Professor Frazer’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Golden Bough</i>, and puts together what one finds there about the boar that killed Diarmuid, and other old Celtic boars and sows, one sees that the battle is mythological, and that the Pig it is named from must be a type of cold and winter doing battle with the summer, or of death battling with life. For the purposes of poetry, at any rate, I think it a symbol of the darkness that will destroy the world. The country people say there is no shape for a spirit to take so dangerous as the shape of a pig; and a Galway blacksmith⁠—and blacksmiths are thought to be specially protected⁠—says he would be afraid to meet a pig on the road at night; and another Galway man tells this story: “There was a man coming the road from Gort to Garryland one night, and he had a drop taken; and before him, on the road, he saw a pig walking; and having a drop in, he gave a shout, and made a kick at it, and bid it get out of that. And by the time he got home, his arm was swelled from the shoulder to be as big as a bag, and he couldn’t use his hand with the pain of it. And his wife brought him, after a few days, to a woman that used to do cures at Rahasane. And on the road all she could do would hardly keep him from lying down to sleep on the grass. And when they got to the woman she knew all that happened; ‘and,’ says she, ‘it’s well for you that your wife didn’t let you fall asleep on the grass, for if you had done that but even for one instant, you’d be a lost man.’ ”</p>
					<p>Professor Rhys, who considers the bristleless boar a symbol of darkness and cold, rather than of winter and cold, thinks it was without bristles because the darkness is shorn away by the sun.</p>
					<p>The Battle should, I believe, be compared with three other battles; a battle the Sidhe are said to fight when a person is being taken away by them; a battle they are said to fight in November for the harvest; the great battle the Tuatha De Danaan fought, according to the Gaelic chroniclers, with the Fomor at Moy Tura, or the Towery Plain.</p>
					<p>I have heard of the battle over the dying both in County Galway and in the Isles of Aran, an old Aran fisherman having told me that it was fought over two of his children, and that he found blood in a box he had for keeping fish, when it was over; and I have written about it, and given examples elsewhere. A faery doctor, on the borders of Galway and Clare, explained it as a battle between the friends and enemies of the dying, the one party trying to take them, the other trying to save them from being taken. It may once, when the land of the Sidhe was the only other world, and when every man who died was carried thither, have always accompanied death. I suggest that the battle between the Tuatha De Danaan, the powers of light, and warmth, and fruitfulness, and goodness, and the Fomor, the powers of darkness, and cold, and barrenness, and badness upon the Towery Plain, was the establishment of the habitable world, the rout of the ancestral darkness; that the battle among the Sidhe for the harvest is the annual battle of summer and winter; that the battle among the Sidhe at a man’s death is the battle of life and death; and that the battle of the Black Pig is the battle between the manifest world and the ancestral darkness at the end of all things; and that all these battles are one, the battle of all things with shadowy decay. Once a symbolism has possessed the imagination of large numbers of men, it becomes, as I believe, an embodiment of disembodied powers, and repeats itself in dreams and visions, age after age. <a href="poetry.xhtml#noteref-15" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>I find that I have unintentionally changed the old story of Conchubar’s death. He did not see the Crucifixion in a vision, but was told about it. He had been struck by a ball made of the dried brains of an enemy and hurled out of a sling; and this ball had been left in his head and his head had been mended, the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Book of Leinster</i> says, with thread of gold because his hair was like gold. Keating, a writer of the time of Elizabeth, says, “In that state did he remain seven years, until the Friday on which Christ was crucified, according to some historians; and when he saw the unusual changes of the creation and the eclipse of the sun and the moon at its full, he asked of Bucrach, a Leinster Druid, who was along with him, what was it that brought that unusual change upon the planets of Heaven and Earth. ‘Jesus Christ, the Son of God,’ said the Druid, ‘who is now being crucified by the Jews.’ ‘That is a pity,’ said Conchubar; ‘were I in his presence I would kill those who were putting him to death.’ And with that he brought out his sword, and rushed at a woody grove which was convenient to him, and began to cut and fell it; and what he said was, that if he were among the Jews, that was the usage he would give them, and from the excessiveness of his fury which seized upon him, the ball started out of his head, and some of the brain came after it, and in that way he died. The wood of Lanshraigh, in Feara Rois, is the name by which that shrubby wood is called.”</p>

					<p>Presently, because of his great love, he gave up his throne to Conchubar, her son by another, and lived out his days feasting, and fighting, and hunting. His promise never to refuse a feast from a certain comrade, and the mischief that came by his promise, and the vengeance he took afterwards, are a principal theme of the poets.

A young man “saw a light before him on the high road. When he came as far, there was an open box on the road, and a light coming up out of it. He took up the box. There was a lock of hair in it. Presently he had to go to become the servant of a king for his living. There were eleven boys. When they were going out into the stable at ten o’clock, each of them took a light but he. He took no candle at all with him. Each of them went into his own stable. When he went into his stable he opened the box. He left it in a hole in the wall. The light was great. It was twice as much as in the other stables.” The king hears of it, and makes him show him the box.

					<p><strong>“The Poet Pleads with the Elemental Powers;” “He Thinks of His Past Greatness When a Part of the Constellations of Heaven;” “He Hears the Cry of the Sedge.”</strong>⁠—The Rose has been for many centuries a symbol of spiritual love and supreme beauty. The lotus was in some Eastern countries imagined blossoming upon the Tree of Life, as the Flower of Life, and is thus represented in Assyrian bas-reliefs. Because the Rose, the flower sacred to the Virgin Mary, and the flower that Apuleius’ adventurer ate, when he was changed out of the ass’s shape and received into the fellowship of Isis, is the western Flower of Life, I have imagined it growing upon the Tree of Life. I once stood beside a man in Ireland when he saw it growing there in a vision, that seemed to have rapt him out of his body. He saw the Garden of Eden walled about, and on the top of a high mountain, as in certain medieval diagrams, and after passing the Tree of Knowledge, on which grew fruit full of troubled faces, and through whose branches flowed, he was told, sap that was human souls, he came to a tall, dark tree, with little bitter fruits, and was shown a kind of stair or ladder going up through the tree, and told to go up; and near the top of the tree, a beautiful woman, like the Goddess of Life, associated with the tree in Assyria, gave him a rose that seemed to have been growing upon the tree. One finds the Rose in the Irish poets, sometimes as a religious symbol, as in the phrase, “the Rose of Friday,” meaning the Rose of austerity, in a Gaelic poem in <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Hyde’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Religious Songs of Connacht</i>; and, I think, as a symbol of woman’s beauty in the Gaelic song, “Roseen Dubh”; and a symbol of Ireland in Mangan’s adaptation of “Roseen Dubh,” “My Dark Rosaleen,” and in <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Aubrey de Vere’s “The Little Black Rose.” I do not know any evidence to prove whether this symbol came to Ireland with medieval Christianity, or whether it has come down from older times. I have read somewhere that a stone engraved with a Celtic god, who holds what looks like a rose in one hand, has been found somewhere in England; but I cannot find the reference, though I certainly made a note of it. If the Rose was really a symbol of Ireland among the Gaelic poets, and if “Roseen Dubh” is really a political poem, as some think, one may feel pretty certain that the ancient Celts associated the Rose with Eire, or Fotla, or Banba⁠—goddesses who gave their names to Ireland⁠—or with some principal god or goddess, for such symbols are not suddenly adopted or invented, but come out of mythology.</p>
					<p>I have made the Seven Lights, the constellation of the Bear, lament for the theft of the Rose, and I have made the Dragon, the constellation Draco, the guardian of the Rose, because these constellations move about the pole of the heavens, the ancient Tree of Life in many countries, and are often associated with the Tree of Life in mythology. It is this Tree of Life that I have put into the “Song of Mongan” under its common Irish form of a hazel; and, because it had sometimes the stars for fruit, I have hung upon it “the Crooked Plough” and the “Pilot Star,” as Gaelic-speaking Irishmen sometimes call the Bear and the North star. I have made it an axletree in “Aedh hears the Cry of the Sedge,” for this was another ancient way of representing it. <a href="poetry.xhtml#noteref-17" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p><strong>Poems Beginning with That “To a Wealthy Man” and Ending with That “To a Shade.”</strong>⁠—During the thirty years or so during which I have been reading Irish newspapers, three public controversies have stirred my imagination. The first was the Parnell controversy. There were reasons to justify a man’s joining either party, but there were none to justify, on one side or on the other, lying accusations forgetful of past service, a frenzy of detraction. And another was the dispute over <i epub:type="se:name.publication.play">The Playboy</i>. There were reasons for opposing as for supporting that violent, laughing thing, but none for the lies, for the unscrupulous rhetoric spread against it in Ireland, and from Ireland to America. The third prepared for the Corporation’s refusal of a building for Sir Hugh Lane’s famous collection of pictures.</p>
					<p>One could respect the argument that Dublin, with much poverty and many slums, could not afford the £22,000 the building was to cost the city, but not the minds that used it. One frenzied man compared the pictures to Troy horse which “destroyed a city,” and innumerable correspondents described Sir Hugh Lane and those who had subscribed many thousands to give Dublin paintings by Corot, Manet, Monet, Degas, and Renoir, as “self -seekers,” “self -advertisers,” “picture-dealers,” “logrolling cranks and faddists,” and one clerical paper told “picture-dealer Lane” to take himself and his pictures out of that. A member of the Corporation said there were Irish artists who could paint as good if they had a mind to, and another described a half-hour in the temporary gallery in Harcourt Street as the most dismal of his life. Some one else asked instead of these eccentric pictures to be given pictures “like those beautiful productions displayed in the windows of our city picture shops.” Another thought that we would all be more patriotic if we devoted our energy to fighting the Insurance Act. Another would not hang them in his kitchen, while yet another described the vogue of French impressionist painting as having gone to such a length among “logrolling enthusiasts” that they even admired “works that were rejected from the Salon forty years ago by the finest critics in the world.”</p>
					<p>The first serious opposition began in the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.newspaper">Irish Catholic</i>, the chief Dublin clerical paper, and <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> William Murphy, the organiser of the recent lockout and <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Healy’s financial supporter in his attack upon Parnell, a man of great influence, brought to its support a few days later his newspapers <i epub:type="se:name.publication.newspaper">The Evening Herald</i> and <i epub:type="se:name.publication.newspaper">The Irish Independent</i>, the most popular of Irish daily papers. He replied to my poem “To a Wealthy Man” (I was thinking of a very different wealthy man) from what he described as “Paudeen’s point of view,” and “Paudeen’s point of view” it was. The enthusiasm for “Sir Hugh Lane’s Corots”⁠—one paper spelled the name repeatedly “Crot”⁠—being but “an exotic fashion,” waited “some satirist like Gilbert” who “killed the aesthetic craze,” and as for the rest “there were no greater humbugs in the world than art critics and so-called experts.” As the first avowed reason for opposition, the necessities of the poor got but a few lines, not so many certainly as the objection of various persons to supply Sir Hugh Lane with “a monument at the city’s expense,” and as the gallery was supported by <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> James Larkin, the chief Labour leader, and important slum workers, I assume that the purpose of the opposition was not exclusively charitable.</p>
					<p>[<i>In 1917 and later editions Yeats replaced the above with:</i> I leave out two long paragraphs which have been published in earlier editions of these poems. There is no need now to defend Sir Hugh Lane’s pictures against Dublin newspapers. The trustees of the London National Gallery, through his leaving a codicil to his will unwitnessed, have claimed the pictures for London, and propose to build a wing to the Tate Gallery to contain them. Some that were hostile are now contrite, and doing what they can, or letting others do unhindered what they can, to persuade Parliament to such action as may restore the collection to Ireland.]</p>
					<p>These controversies, political, literary, and artistic, have showed that neither religion nor politics can of itself create minds with enough receptivity to become wise, or just and generous enough to make a nation. Other cities have been as stupid⁠—Samuel Butler laughs at shocked Montreal for hiding the <i epub:type="se:name.visual-art.sculpture">Discobolus</i> in a cellar⁠—but Dublin is the capital of a nation, and an ancient race has nowhere else to look for an education. Goethe in <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Wilhelm Meister</i> describes a saintly and naturally gracious woman, who getting into a quarrel over some trumpery detail of religious observance, grows⁠—she and all her little religious community⁠—angry and vindictive. In Ireland I am constantly reminded of that fable of the futility of all discipline that is not of the whole being. Religious Ireland⁠—and the pious Protestants of my childhood were signal examples⁠—thinks of divine things as a round of duties separated from life and not as an element that may be discovered in all circumstance and emotion, while political Ireland sees the good citizen but as a man who holds to certain opinions and not as a man of good will. Against all this we have but a few educated men and the remnants of an old traditional culture among the poor. Both were stronger forty years ago, before the rise of our new middle class which showed as its first public event, during the nine years of the Parnellite split, how base at moments of excitement are minds without culture. 1914.</p>
					<p>“Romantic Ireland’s dead and gone” sounds old-fashioned now. It seemed true in 1913, but I did not foresee 1916. The late Dublin Rebellion, whatever one can say of its wisdom, will long be remembered for its heroism. “They weighed so lightly what they gave,” and gave too in some cases without hope of success. —July 1916. <a href="poetry.xhtml#noteref-19" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>The fable for this poem came into my head while I was giving some lectures in Dublin.

I remembered that they were the habitual image suggested by blue sky, and looking for a second fable called them “The Magi,” complimentary forms to those enraged dolls. <a href="poetry.xhtml#noteref-20" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p><strong>“The Phases of the Moon,” “The Double Vision of Michael Robartes,” “Michael Robartes and the Dancer.”</strong>⁠—Years ago I wrote three stories in which occur the names of Michael Robartes and Owen Aherne. I now consider that I used the actual names of two friends, and that one of these friends, Michael Robartes, has but lately returned from Mesopotamia where he has partly found and partly thought out much philosophy. I consider that John Aherne is either the original of Owen Aherne or some near relation of the man that was, and that both he and Robartes, to whose namesake I had attributed a turbulent life and death, have quarrelled with me. They take their place in a phantasmagoria in which I endeavour to explain my philosophy of life and death, and till that philosophy has found some detailed exposition in prose certain passages in the poems named above may seem obscure. To some extent I wrote them as a text for exposition.⁠—1922. <a href="poetry.xhtml#noteref-22" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-23" epub:type="endnote">
					<p>Robartes writes to Aherne under the date May 12th, 1917. “I found among the Judwalis much biographical detail, probably legendary, about Kusta-ben-Luki. He saw occasionally during sleep a woman’s face and later on found in a Persian painting a face resembling, though not identical with the dream-face, which was he considered that of a woman loved in another life. Presently he met &amp; loved a beautiful woman whose face also resembled, without being identical, that of his dream. Later on he made a long journey to purchase the painting which was, he said, the better likeness, and found on his return that his mistress had left him in a fit of jealousy.” In a dialogue and in letters, Robartes gives a classification and analysis of dreams which explain the survival of this story among the followers of Kusta-ben-Luki. They distinguished between the memory of concrete images and the abstract memory, and affirm that no concrete dream-image is ever from our memory. This is not only true they say of dreams, but of those visions seen between sleeping and waking. This doctrine at first found me incredulous, for I thought it contradicted by my experience and by all I have read, not however a very great amount, in books of psychology and of psychoanalysis. Did I not frequently dream of some friend, or relation, or that I was at school? I found, however, when I studied my dreams, as I was directed in a dialogue, that the image seen was never really that of friend, or relation, or my old school, though it might very closely resemble it. A substitution had taken place, often a very strange one, though I forgot this if I did not notice it at once on waking. The name of some friend, or the conceptions “my father” and “at school,” are a part of the abstract memory and therefore of the dream life, but the image of my father, or my friend, or my old school, being a part of the personal concrete memory appeared neither in sleep nor in visions between sleep and waking. I found sometimes that my father, or my friend, had been represented in sleep by a stool or a chair, and I concluded that it was the entire absence of my personal concrete memory that enabled me to accept such images without surprise. Was it not perhaps this very absence that constituted sleep? Would I perhaps awake if a single concrete image from my memory came before me? Even these images⁠—stool, chair, <abbr>etc.</abbr> were never any particular stool, chair, <abbr>etc.</abbr> that I had known. Were these images, however, from the buried memory? had they floated up from the subconscious? had I seen them perhaps a long time ago and forgotten having done so? Even if that were so, the exclusion of the conscious memory was a new, perhaps important truth; but Robartes denied their source even in the subconscious. It seems a corroboration that though I often see between sleep and waking elaborate landscape, I have never seen one that seemed a possible representation of any place I have ever lived near from childhood up. Robartes traces these substitute images to different sources. Those that come in sleep are (1) from the state immediately preceding our birth; (2) from the <i xml:lang="la">Spiritus Mundi</i>⁠—that is to say, from a general storehouse of images which have ceased to be a property of any personality or spirit. Those that come between sleeping and waking are, he says, reshaped by what he calls the “automatic faculty” which can create pattern, balance, <abbr>etc.</abbr> from the impressions made upon the senses, not of ourselves, but of others bound to us by certain emotional links though perhaps entire strangers, and preserved in a kind of impersonal mirror, often simply called the “record,” which takes much the same place in his system the lower strata of the astral light does among the disciples of Elephas Levi. This does not exhaust the contents of dreams for we have to account also for certain sentences, for certain ideas which are not concrete images and yet do not arise from our personal memory, but at the moment I have merely to account for certain images that affect passion or affection. Robartes writes to Aherne in a letter dated May 15th, 1917: “No lover, no husband has ever met in dreams the true image of wife or mistress. She who has perhaps filled his whole life with joy or disquiet cannot enter there. Her image can fill every moment of his waking life but only its counterfeit comes to him in sleep; and he who classifies these counterfeits will find that just in so far as they become concrete, sensuous, they are distinct individuals; never types but individuals. They are the forms of those whom he has loved in some past earthly life, chosen from <i xml:lang="la">Spiritus Mundi</i> by the subconscious will, and through them, for they are not always hollow shades, the dead at whiles outface a living rival.” They are the forms of Over Shadowers as they are called. All violent passion has to be expiated or atoned, by one in life, by one in the state between life and life, because, as the Judwalis believe, there is always deceit or cruelty; but it is only in sleep that we can see these forms of those who as spirits may influence all our waking thought. Souls that are once linked by emotion never cease till the last drop of that emotion is exhausted⁠—call it desire, hate or what you will⁠—to affect one another, remaining always as it were in contact. Those whose past passions are unatoned seldom love living man or woman but only those loved long ago, of whom the living man or woman is but a brief symbol forgotten when some phase of some atonement is finished; but because in general the form does not pass into the memory, it is the moral being of the dead that is symbolised. Under certain circumstances, which are precisely described, the form indirectly, and not necessarily from dreams, enters the living memory; the subconscious will, as in Kusta-ben-Luki in the story, selects among pictures, or other ideal representations, some form that resembles what was once the physical body of the Over Shadower, and this ideal form becomes to the living man an obsession, continually perplexing and frustrating natural instinct. It is therefore only after full atonement or expiation, perhaps after many lives, that a natural deep satisfying love becomes possible, and this love, in all subjective natures, must precede the Beatific Vision.</p>
					<p>When I wrote “An Image from a Past Life,” I had merely begun my study of the various papers upon the subject, but I do not think I misstated Robartes’ thought in permitting the woman and not the man to see the Over Shadower or Ideal Form, whichever it was. No mind’s contents are necessarily shut off from another, and in moments of excitement images pass from one mind to another with extraordinary ease, perhaps most easily from that portion of the mind which for the time being is outside consciousness. I use the word “pass” because it is familiar, not because I believe any movement in space to be necessary. The second mind sees what the first has already seen, that is all. <a href="poetry.xhtml#noteref-23" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

				<li id="note-24" epub:type="endnote">
					<p>Robartes copied out and gave to Aherne several mathematical diagrams from the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Speculum</i>, squares and spheres, cones made up of revolving gyres intersecting each other at various angles, figures sometimes of great complexity. His explanation of these, obtained invariably from the followers of Kusta-ben-Luki, is founded upon a single fundamental thought. The mind, whether expressed in history or in the individual life, has a precise movement, which can be quickened or slackened but cannot be fundamentally altered, and this movement can be expressed by a mathematical form. A plant or an animal has an order of developement peculiar to it, a bamboo will not develop evenly like a willow, nor a willow from joint to joint, and both have branches, that lessen and grow more light as they rise, and no characteristic of the soil can alter these things. A poor soil may indeed check or stop the movement and a rich prolong and quicken it. Mendel has shown that his sweet-peas bred long and short, white and pink varieties in certain mathematical proportions, suggesting a mathematical law governing the transmission of parental characteristics. To the Judwalis, as interpreted by Michael Robartes, all living mind has likewise a fundamental mathematical movement, however adapted in plant, or animal, or man to particular circumstance; and when you have found this movement and calculated its relations, you can foretell the entire future of that mind. A supreme religious act of their faith is to fix the attention on the mathematical form of this movement until the whole past and future of humanity, or of an individual man, shall be present to the intellect as if it were accomplished in a single moment. The intensity of the Beatific Vision when it comes depends upon the intensity of this realisation. It is possible in this way, seeing that death is itself marked upon the mathematical figure, which passes beyond it, to follow the soul into the highest heaven and the deepest hell. This doctrine is, they contend, not fatalistic because the mathematical figure is an expression of the mind’s desire, and the more rapid the developement of the figure the greater the freedom of the soul. The figure while the soul is in the body, or suffering from the consequences of that life, is frequently drawn as a double cone, the narrow end of each cone being in the centre of the broad end of the other.</p>
					<figure id="illustration-1">
						<img alt="A line drawing of two cones superimposed on each other, with the tip of each cone in the centre of the base of the other." src="../images/illustration-1.svg" epub:type="z3998:illustration se:image.color-depth.black-on-transparent"/>
					</figure>
					<p class="continued">It has its origin from a straight line which represents, now time, now emotion, now subjective life, and a plane at right angles to this line which represents, now space, now intellect, now objective life; while it is marked out by two gyres which represent the conflict, as it were, of plane and line, by two movements, which circle about a centre because a movement outward on the plane is checked by and in turn checks a movement onward upon the line; &amp; the circling is always narrowing or spreading, because one movement or other is always the stronger. In other words, the human soul is always moving outward into the objective world or inward into itself; &amp; this movement is double because the human soul would not be conscious were it not suspended between contraries, the greater the contrast the more intense the consciousness. The man, in whom the movement inward is stronger than the movement outward, the man who sees all reflected within himself, the subjective man, reaches the narrow end of a gyre at death, for death is always, they contend, even when it seems the result of accident, preceded by an intensification of the subjective life; and has a moment of revelation immediately after death, a revelation which they describe as his being carried into the presence of all his dead kindred, a moment whose objectivity is exactly equal to the subjectivity of death. The objective man on the other hand, whose gyre moves outward, receives at this moment the revelation, not of himself seen from within, for that is impossible to objective man, but of himself as if he were somebody else. This figure is true also of history, for the end of an age, which always receives the revelation of the character of the next age, is represented by the coming of one gyre to its place of greatest expansion and of the other to that of its greatest contraction. At the present moment the life gyre is sweeping outward, unlike that before the birth of Christ which was narrowing, and has almost reached its greatest expansion. The revelation which approaches will however take its character from the contrary movement of the interior gyre. All our scientific, democratic, fact-accumulating, heterogeneous civilization belongs to the outward gyre and prepares not the continuance of itself but the revelation as in a lightning flash, though in a flash that will not strike only in one place, and will for a time be constantly repeated, of the civilization that must slowly take its place. This is too simple a statement, for much detail is possible. There are certain points of stress on outer and inner gyre, a division of each, now into ten, now into twenty-eight, stages or phases. However in the exposition of this detail so far as it affects the future, Robartes had little help from the Judwalis either because they cannot grasp events outside their experience, or because certain studies seem to them unlucky. “ ‘For a time the power’ they have said to me,” (writes Robartes) “ ‘will be with us, who are as like one another as the grains of sand, but when the revelation comes it will not come to the poor but to the great and learned and establish again for two thousand years prince &amp; vizier. Why should we resist? Have not our wise men marked it upon the sand, and it is because of these marks, made generation after generation by the old for the young, that we are named Judwalis.’ ”</p>

					<p>When I wrote the lines about Plato and Plotinus I forgot that it is something in our own eyes that makes us see them as all transcendence. Has not Plotinus written: “Let every soul recall, then, at the outset the truth that soul is the author of all living things, that it has breathed the life into them all, whatever is nourished by earth and sea, all the creatures of the air, the divine stars in the sky; it is the maker of the sun; itself formed and ordered this vast heaven and conducts all that rhythmic motion⁠—and it is a principle distinct from all these to which it gives law and movement and life, and it must of necessity be more honourable than they, for they gather or dissolve as soul brings them life or abandons them, but soul, since it never can abandon itself, is of eternal being.” <a href="poetry.xhtml#noteref-27" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
